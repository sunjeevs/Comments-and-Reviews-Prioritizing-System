However, when I recently bought it for my grandson, I was unable to locate some of the free programs I had used with my students. There were many to purchase though.It is easy to use, once you read through all the directions, and there is also a few videos on the product website, and on YouTube. I highly recommend you watch those as well before using the product.My grandson, who just turned right, did have a lot of fun with it, and was running all over my house to find things he could use to complete the circuit.

       " \"Made for a very interesting and unique gift that requires a little bit of work, creativity, and imagination that I think is needed these days.  My niece wanted this and I had no idea what it was so I researched it a little and was surprised that she knew what this was and wanted it.  While there are a lot of ways to play with this at its base it is fairly simple and easy to learn and use.  I appreciate that it combines gaming and electronics with a little bit of learning, creativity, imagination and inventiveness.I gave it only 4 stars because I don't think this is for everyone.  If you're planning to buy this for a present, you should really see if this is the kind of thing that person/child wants.  If you think someone might like it as a gift they might also need someone to show them the kind of fun they can enjoy with this. It is an interesting concept and the possibilities are near limitless but I think anyone that hasn't researched the Makey Makey at all and are considering it for a gift, to really read into what it is and what it can be.The price is a little steep in my opinion at about $50.  I think $35-$40 would have been a sweet spot but it is well made and designed and I have no issue spending a little more to support innovative ideas.  I can happily recommend this.\",\n",

Making playdough buttons and such.I would like to see it support more than just a few buttons though.

They are some distance away and I need to see how well he works with this, but if my daughter is happy, so am I .  I wish that there had been more information on the page selling this product.  I would not recommend to someone who is not familiar with internet processes or unavailable to a Wifi network.\",\n",

Very small and compact, easy to set up and use, and clear to understand if you're familiar with electronics and circuitry.The major problem that I have is for the price point, I would expect at the very least to get some quality alligator clips to connect to the conductors. The springs in the clips don't put enough tension to even close, and they definitely don't hold on to what they're clipped to. I definitely expected more durable connectors, and will have to shop for more elsewhere.\",\n",
       " 'I currently teach Integrated Technology K-5 and purchased this for an enrichment activity in my Tech Club. The first time I used it I had to launch several projects at the same time, so the students who signed up to use these were simply handed the unopened box and requested to read the directions and look around at the various parts until I could get back to their group to get them started. Without any instruction other than that, but the time I returned to them they had independently hooked up various objects to it and was using it like a piano. The students were in 4th and 5th grade. Very easy to use, and with guidance this could be used in a 1st grade setting. There are some projects already outlined in the instructions/available on their website making it very simple to get started. Of course, it is also a device that is very open ended and may be used in more creative ways by students as well. Highly recommend!',\n",

It's a lot of fun to figure out what has enough capacitance to work and what does not.  Most interesting discovery . . . . chocolate DIDN'T work.Tip - I bought a larger set of alligator clips so I would have more clips and bigger jaws to grip things.  BUT the holes where you attach the Makey Makey were too small to let the larger clips get in to grip.  So if you need more clips, don't get the bigger ones.I think $50 is too high for this product although it does what it says it will do.\",\n",

My favorite student created projects include a tiny drum set made with Gaterade tops covered with tin foil and attached to a shoe box with tooth picks. This was a tiny drum set attached to a music program on the Makey Makey web site. We watched a TED talk and other youtube videos to introduce the Makey Makey. A fun and creative kit.

As an example, connecting this to paper, fabric, plastic, cardboard, glass, wood, rubber etc will NOT work. That removes about 90% of the potential of this. And to boot, you need a ground strap attached to your fricken body for it to trigger. Trust me when I say this, I am a 30+ year veteran of the IT industry and this entire kit can be replaced with about 5 dollars in parts and an Arduino. Even the included alligator clips are bad quality for goodness sake. Just absolutely bottom of the barrel materials with a massive price tag.Now if you're really set on this for some reason (seriously its a massive ripoff don't bother), you can get most materials to work by drawing on them with a graphite pencil, using tin foil, or ducting tape (the metal kind, not DUCT TAPE) but by then why even bother, and you still have to have the ground attached.Total disappointment on this one.\",\n",

I set up OctoPrint for my 3D printer and wanted to use the timelapse feature.  This camera works and image quality is ok, but there are mounting issues that you have to solve and the ok quality is just that-- only ok.  With only a little bit more configuration, I was able to set up OctoPrint with a Logitech c900 series USB webcam.  I was really surprised at just how easy it was to set up-- it seems that many USB cameras are basically at the plug-and-play level of compatibility with Raspbian.  I just needed to point OctoPrint\\'s streaming service to the correct device, and it worked.Benefits of using a USB camera instead of this one:- Image quality can be much better (especially in low light),- Mounting is easier,- It\\'s in a more rugged/sealed enclosure, and- Because USB cameras usually come with a cable attached, your Pi can be several feet away from the camera.  In my case, having the camera mounted to the print bed and placing the Pi a few feet away is a much nicer solution than I could have achieved with the official RPi Camera.Benefits of using THIS camera instead of USB:- If you want a camera and Pi integrated into the same case, this camera is probably the best (only) choice- Power consumption is probably lower.  (USB cameras might need to be connected to the Pi through a powered hub)- It is likely to be cheaper, depending on the USB camera that you\\'re considering- In my experience, this camera was SLIGHTLY easier to set up (although USB camera setup was not really difficult at all)',\n",
       " \"QUICK SUMMARY:  Amazing steal for just a few bucks, with tons of potential for those motivated to learn.  Highly recommended!BACKGROUND:  I only came to the Raspberry Pi world a few months ago as of this writing, and quite by accident.  Originally, I bought just a Raspberry Pi to inspire my pre-teen son, but quickly got hooked myself.  Adding this camera to a Raspberry Pi made sense as it opens up a ton of creative opportunities and, for me specifically, helped me replace WiFi home surveillance cameras which no longer worked reliably following a company buy-out.WHAT I LIKE:- Inexpensive!  Add a 5MB camera for under thirty bucks?  Yes, please!- Easy to install!  Pop up a locking tab on the Raspberry Pi, insert the ribbon, lock the tab into place and, done!- Easy to immediately use!  I use the Picamera library and have had a lot of success using that to get photos- Add a wide-angle lens!  Sold separately, I bought a somewhat clunky wide-angle clip-on lens and greatly improved the utility of this camera- Great quality photos if you're taking outside shots in bright light; otherwise, they're okay (but great for the money spent)- Trouble-free.  I've bought three of these cameras for three Pi's and all are working reliably, even outdoors under my eavesWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The camera comes with only one, default ribbon cable which for me is just barely long enough.  I'd prefer having ordering options where the customer could choose how long of a cable to go along with the camera board.  (Yes, you can buy ribbon cables separately, but that's at a greater cost and the shorter ribbon needlessly becomes a throw-away attachment).CONCLUSION:  Great item at an even greater value proposition.  Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"Good camera, easy to setup and use, with surprisingly good image quality in daylight; however, after the latest software update, I was unable to get it to take still pictures any faster than one every 2.3 sec, whatever the size of the image and without any processing, despite what the documentation seems to imply. The video is fast enough, but that's not what I wanted.Also, it is **really** static-sensitive....A few months later:In his blog, Miguel Mota describes how to stream video from the Pi and it turns out that the stream is actually a sequence of jpeg pictures (about 10 per second). It is trivial to split this stream into individual pictures and to process them for motion detection. The limitation of still pictures to a very low rate clearly results from a defective software implementation.\",\n",
       " \"Worked as expected.  Not great in low light but it's about what you'd expect.  It is easy to hook up, easy to control from Python and worked with every demo bundled in Raspbian, The cable is very short.  You can buy a longer one from Adafruit for cheap, but they warn you that longer cables may have data corruption.  I haven't tried them.  I would like it if the board was more compact.  The CCD is a small portion of the board so I think this is doable.  The board is relatively heavy and doesn't like to be propped against anything.  You pretty much have to build a mount for it or hold it with your hands.\",\n",

Vielleicht gibt es bald eine Version ohne integrierten IR-Filter, so dass eine Ausleuchtung mit IR-Scheinwerfer bei Dunkelheit diese Schwäche kompensiert.',\n",
