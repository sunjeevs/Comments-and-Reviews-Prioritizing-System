0,"It’s good that they have the return/replacement policy. I had to return it because one of the channels wasn’t working, i had checked on t6config as well, channel 2 wasn’t responding. The replacement came quick and now everything works. But still I would recommend to buy the one that has screen on it because the software they provide is really old and doesn’t work with newer version of windows. I couldn’t find any working software for my mac as well, so i had fond a win8 system to configure it."
1,Product is being shelled at high price if you want you can buy it from robu.in
2,"First time similar item received in damaged condition.  Item was return and timely refund received.This time item was received in good condition, but Data cable, set-up CD &  manual were missing.Kindly arrange to deliver the missing items.Regards"
3,Easy to use...nice product
4,Overall the product is good and the quality which is used is good but the cd which come along is blank and i couldn't able to install the drivers of it to calibrate.
5,I buy this but in pakage  binding cable is not there and not back cover of battery for close it as in photo
6,"It is very genuine product. I have not done the range test yet but it seems like it's good in that part. Only drawback of this transmitter is, it takes lot of power i.e batteries."

104,A cell was not detecting by the charger and when it delivered it was used product and it's charging pins were damaged so well that I have to cut and add my own jumper wires to test it out( I don't had voltmeter)Now I found that the 3rd cell isn't responding to charger and even not giving the full 11.1v it could only transfer 7.4v as it's just a 2S battery I was so dissatisfied and disappointed I don't k ow u people give a replacement or not but i wish to have a replacement or return if possible. Cant u check once before shipping whether the returned products are in good condition or not and u just sent me this product without any further ado. Okay now let's speak about the battery it was good and compact. If it had 3S working I was about to complete my project due to this I had to stop. I do need help in setting this situation right.
105,Good product at a very good price
106,Long time battery🔋 super
107,It is expensive in cost and when you charge it with different charger it will work less effective and will be damage within year.
108,"It's working good,but time to analise battery life may take longer. So now it is working as mentioned in the product description."
109,Works ok but it has inflated after only 3 times of charging with a balance charger. A little dangerous to use I suppose.

125,All 3 cells are working fine
126,Good quality with in tree day delivery
127,
128,got a problematic battery with a defective cell but they replaced it with a nee battery. it is working great. always use a balance charger preferably which shows mah rating and cell voltage. never discharge below 9 volts under any circumstances
129,Battery is puffed so had to return. Seems like this is a common issue with the seller. This puffed batteries are a fire hazard and a huge risk. Also the listing shows a deans connector but it's actually a XT60. Disappointing service from Amazon on the return policy too.
130,good  quality
131,good
132,battery is ok.  good service..
133,Great battery never really got any problem but my 15000 rs drone flew away with it never found it in CHANDIGARH 😭 after a month of building and testing never fly a drone without gps . BROs never plz

171,Nice product but could be cheaper
172,Nice product
173,Good
174,Good
175,Watch unboxing & review video on youtube/meradiy
176,The product quality and working and all fine. But this will not help in the log run..If you can spend some more money to get a advanced board which will have barometer and GPS capabilities..This board will help us to fly but it is unstable as is lack some needed sensors so this will not lock in one place.. Drone is big so it's dangerous to have it unstable.Got cut by the blades many times. Drone Also fell many times
177,Very good product
178,This is a very nice produce as we are making drone we ordered this to check that are these good bit there were the best the motor with this esc is the fastest so now we have ordered one more super cool product
179,I have 3 out of 4 ESC as SimonK. They are working nice and smooth motor running
180,Ok

183,It is too flimsy. Material selection need to  e thought
184,Good product works good with 10'' propellers also. Nicely fits below the motors.If the bolts were a little bit longer like 1-2mm it would have been better.Overall a good product
185,Packaging was broken and screws were missing
186,Best
187,Product and the package is good and this item was not strong and it is flexible
188,"With a slight modification, it is the best available, just stick approriate lenght barbeque sticks in the bottom groove to have a perfect guard"
189,Product stopped working after single use.Don't buy.

237,"The box arrived on time, however it seems the motor and lighting components were taken out from the package and left alone with the box.The nightmare now is the servo does not work and I am unable to reach the seller.Hope they see this a connect with me"
238,"Absolutely terrible, came with some small parts missing. How are you supposed to build a car with missing parts?"
239,Very low quality charger and battery. I am very disappointed.
240,"everything in this kit is the poorly made in china kinds. The wires are total junk, the resistors are total crap, The battery holder is cheap plastic,the whole kit is worth less than ₹200 when made in large quantities.The only thing good about this kit is the PCB and the 2 100uF electrolytic capacitors. The manual is in chinese, and luckily since I have a good background in electronics, I could get it to work. The heart of this circuit a ₹15 LM393 comparator looks so cheapThe biggest joke is that they say its MRP is ₹1048. For just about ₹1000, you can pick up a Arduino based kit with a motor controller, IR sensor unitMy review is not about the seller - I don't know them. Its about this product, and I want you to be conscious of this product.Stay away from this - Just don't buy this junk - I have just warned you!"
241,nice
242,"Durable,Nice product. very low price."
243,"I ordered this Robocraze Dual Shaft BO motor with wheel for my son for DIY car as he is keen to do such things.My son has done a car with these motors and wheels using cardboard, and works well with 1.5 v AA batteries."
244,"Very good product except that one of the wheels is short and not good. It's very thick and not very usable. Except for that wheel, the other wheels and gear motors are very good."
245,Good for project but 2 motors making noise.
246,Nice awesome
247,"Tyres were pretty good,wheels were also of good quality.Only reason for 4 stars is that tyre comes out of the rim when we operate it.However that's not a deal breaker, simply use some adhesive to hold it in place."
248,Very nice!!!! Motors are very powerful and wheels are made of pure rubber. Very good quality. Packaging was very good. However the battery gets drained a bit fast when connected . No other problems though. If you are planning to buy gear motors this should be your first option.
249,nice

314,"its suite for only small box for its cooling, not useful to a big box, room etc. very small size use only. i think about 10 piece of same product make any sense."
315,Not appropriate for refrigerator
316,The peltier module is supposed to cool down to minus (-) temperatures but after testing it multiple time i never see it going down 13⁰C l. Regretting purchasing this module
317,I bought two same kit . One kit are working properly but the another one not working properly ..not good as expectedThanks...
318,I used 20days for cool water. Working properly. Cooling 300ml water take 10 minutes
319,Everything is perfect . I must say heatsink is beautiful and the size of the fan is big and it's quality in noise reduction is very good.
320,40mm fan + gard  box me nehi
321,Works fine
322,"This product work well. I tried this product at 12V 3A, the lowest temperature attended was 12 degree centigade. I have to try this with 12V 6A, which may generate temperature well bellow 0 degree centigrade."
323,"Product quality is absolutely inconsistent. I bought 2 units of this from the same seller. I've supplied same amount of power to both the units, and yet one of them achieves 15 degrees on the cold side while the other doesn't go below 25 degrees. I'm highly unsatisfied with the product."
324,"No heating, no cooling after connecting with 12v5amp charger and using ample thermal grease between heat sink tried to test with normal connection and it blew up the +ve wire not can't use can't return money waste"
325,*Amazing product.*Good condition.*Good packing
326,Good. But. It's. Cooling. Not. As. Expect
327,"40 mm fan missing,Not work properly"
328,fan net is missing. ok product.
329,It works super
330,Good
331,Gr-8 working
332,Thermoelectric module achieve 5 degree Celsius.Nice product
333,Damaged product don't buy not at all working
334,Good
335,This product I lick
336,Good product
337,Presentation of product good but outcome is not as expected 😥😥
338,"This board does not come in the original MakeyMakey packaging, there is no user manual in the box either. Although the product works as the MakeyMakey does. This is not the v1.2 or greater variant, so the keys cannot be remapped."
339,Nice gadget for children to engave them in some logical and scientific activity. Happy to use this for my child

341,Nice gadget for children to engave them in some logical and scientific activity. Happy to use this for my child
342,"I am totally disappointed, with the product received. It is definitely an opened/used product. The seal wasn't intact as you can see in pics. The circuit behind the board was also bent. And it did not come in original makey makey box as shown proudly in the advertised pictures. Well I have used this board before and there is no saying that it's a wonderful kitforkids. But I think sending a used kit like this is just cheap. I have sent for a replacement and I am hoping I will not be cheated this time."
343,Interesting kit.
344,Nice one
345,Good toy lots of fun but a bit too fun like i made a arcade game
346,"We purchased this as a birthday gift for a friend's son and out of all his bday presents, this was his favorite. They've spent hours learning and playing with this kit. An invaluable gift."
347,"I had several of the Makey Makey kits for the students in my classroom a few years back. At that time, the students were able to access free programs that would work with Makey Makey. However, when I recently bought it for my grandson, I was unable to locate some of the free programs I had used with my students. There were many to purchase though.It is easy to use, once you read through all the directions, and there is also a few videos on the product website, and on YouTube. I highly recommend you watch those as well before using the product.My grandson, who just turned right, did have a lot of fun with it, and was running all over my house to find things he could use to complete the circuit. We used bananas, cherries, coins, clothes pins, and several other items. It is still a good product, and really brings out the curiosity in children. It is also a good product for the requirements of STEM."
348,"I really like the item, it’s very cool and my ten year old son loves it. But it was meant to be a Christmas gift, it was ordered with the expectation of Prime 2 day shipping. It didn’t come till well after Christmas and that’s not ok. When I ordered an item in the past the shipping speed was always part of my opinion of the product. That’s how it works with me so I give the product here an 8/10 and the shipping a 1/10 only b/c it eventually did arrive. I won’t be renewing Prime."
349,"Made for a very interesting and unique gift that requires a little bit of work, creativity, and imagination that I think is needed these days.  My niece wanted this and I had no idea what it was so I researched it a little and was surprised that she knew what this was and wanted it.  While there are a lot of ways to play with this at its base it is fairly simple and easy to learn and use.  I appreciate that it combines gaming and electronics with a little bit of learning, creativity, imagination and inventiveness.I gave it only 4 stars because I don't think this is for everyone.  If you're planning to buy this for a present, you should really see if this is the kind of thing that person/child wants.  If you think someone might like it as a gift they might also need someone to show them the kind of fun they can enjoy with this. It is an interesting concept and the possibilities are near limitless but I think anyone that hasn't researched the Makey Makey at all and are considering it for a gift, to really read into what it is and what it can be.The price is a little steep in my opinion at about $50.  I think $35-$40 would have been a sweet spot but it is well made and designed and I have no issue spending a little more to support innovative ideas.  I can happily recommend this."
350,"Honestly the components are well made, but it should have come with a case...I 3D printed one for like 30 cents in plastic but for 40 bucks it should have had a case...and a slightly larger box.  Cannot fit everything back in the box once opened.My son likes this, and has had many hours of fun out of it.  Making playdough buttons and such.I would like to see it support more than just a few buttons though.  Perhaps at least as many as is on a game controller...that would be swell.Anyway, over all, decent product, but price was more than I expected."
351,"Gave this to my son, he loved how easy it is to use! His only problem with it is that he can't think of anything else to do with it. The Makey Makey reminds me of an Arduino."
352,"What do you get for a 12 year old?  I tried this based on my niece's suggestion and he seems to love it.  His mother has noted that some of the more advanced features require a laptop interface and, for more complex models, more funds are required via a subscription.  They are some distance away and I need to see how well he works with this, but if my daughter is happy, so am I .  I wish that there had been more information on the page selling this product.  I would not recommend to someone who is not familiar with internet processes or unavailable to a Wifi network."
353,"This is a great item to build DIY projects. Very small and compact, easy to set up and use, and clear to understand if you're familiar with electronics and circuitry.The major problem that I have is for the price point, I would expect at the very least to get some quality alligator clips to connect to the conductors. The springs in the clips don't put enough tension to even close, and they definitely don't hold on to what they're clipped to. I definitely expected more durable connectors, and will have to shop for more elsewhere."
354,"I currently teach Integrated Technology K-5 and purchased this for an enrichment activity in my Tech Club. The first time I used it I had to launch several projects at the same time, so the students who signed up to use these were simply handed the unopened box and requested to read the directions and look around at the various parts until I could get back to their group to get them started. Without any instruction other than that, but the time I returned to them they had independently hooked up various objects to it and was using it like a piano. The students were in 4th and 5th grade. Very easy to use, and with guidance this could be used in a 1st grade setting. There are some projects already outlined in the instructions/available on their website making it very simple to get started. Of course, it is also a device that is very open ended and may be used in more creative ways by students as well. Highly recommend!"
355,
356,Bought as a gift for grand daughter. Box smaller than l thought it would be comes with instruction l Imagine the children will love investigating how to make music from a banana!
357,"Great fun for teaching kids.  Since the unit looks like a keyboard to pretty much all computers, it just works.  No drivers needed.  It's a lot of fun to figure out what has enough capacitance to work and what does not.  Most interesting discovery . . . . chocolate DIDN'T work.Tip - I bought a larger set of alligator clips so I would have more clips and bigger jaws to grip things.  BUT the holes where you attach the Makey Makey were too small to let the larger clips get in to grip.  So if you need more clips, don't get the bigger ones.I think $50 is too high for this product although it does what it says it will do."
358,"My 10 year old granddaughter was elated to receive this at Christmas,,,,she is very smart and loved using it for experiments"
359,"This was my first Makey Makey invention kit and since this purchase I have ordered 5 more for my 2-6 science lab. Students LOVE the Makey Makey. We have turned pie tins and gummy worms in to game controllers for PacMan, Tetris, and Super Mario Brothers. My favorite student created projects include a tiny drum set made with Gaterade tops covered with tin foil and attached to a shoe box with tooth picks. This was a tiny drum set attached to a music program on the Makey Makey web site. We watched a TED talk and other youtube videos to introduce the Makey Makey. A fun and creative kit. It is not a toy kids will use daily but it will keep them busy for awhile and then they will come back to it monthly. Great for a classroom."
360,"O rapaz adorou, agora é só invenções."
361,Ámplia posibilidad de uso. Creatividad al poder.
362,"Honestly this is an INCREDIBLY limited application kit, nowhere near the amount of fun expected. Only works with conductive materials, and even then its iffy. As an example, connecting this to paper, fabric, plastic, cardboard, glass, wood, rubber etc will NOT work. That removes about 90% of the potential of this. And to boot, you need a ground strap attached to your fricken body for it to trigger. Trust me when I say this, I am a 30+ year veteran of the IT industry and this entire kit can be replaced with about 5 dollars in parts and an Arduino. Even the included alligator clips are bad quality for goodness sake. Just absolutely bottom of the barrel materials with a massive price tag.Now if you're really set on this for some reason (seriously its a massive ripoff don't bother), you can get most materials to work by drawing on them with a graphite pencil, using tin foil, or ducting tape (the metal kind, not DUCT TAPE) but by then why even bother, and you still have to have the ground attached.Total disappointment on this one."
363,This is such a good gadget.  My 8 year old son has been having so much fun creating different things with his Makey Makey.  We use a laptop and have found several things to make so far on the Makey Makey website.
364,"I bought the Makey Makey to create ridiculous musical toys after watching videos of banana pianos and watermelon bongos. I wasn't disappointed, it's colourful, easy to use and insanely fun. You can use it as a controller for playing games or to trigger sounds / videos. To be completely honest though, it's really difficult to give the Makey Makey a fair review as the usage possibilities are endless and I've only used it for a handful of musical ideas. With that in mind, take these 5 stars and multiply them to the power of infinity. The Makey Makey is a fantastic micro controller that really sparks the imagination."
365,Es útil para las clases de música con niños.
366,Loved the creative abilities this Makey Makey can offer. Endless possibilities for extending g learning. My 5th graders connected homemade robots to their projects created in Scratch. One broke where the USB needed to be attached with less than 2 weeks use. A similar product available for 1/2 the price.
367,"My grandson age 8 LOVED it, he was beyond stoked! He is an avid gamer and found this to be a pure delight, shared with everyone in the family, got him out of his game into the family fun!!"
368,"These are AWESOME!! I use them as centers in my library, and bought these for my grandchildren. Best activity ever, and so easy to use...go to the makey makey website, plug in USB and attach clips to bananas, apples, playdough, ANYTHING, and make sound, music, etc. Children love these, and adults go nuts over them. Our teachers have as much fun as our students! Highly, highly recommend...particularly if you can get them at a good price, for they are a bit expensive at regular cost."
369,My daughter was so excited for this.  She has had alot of fun creating keyboards out of household items.  This is a great learning tool.
370,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect, however my 11 yr old/ Techie Son had the biggest thrill with this kit.. and so did Mom! Lol  Did not expect to hear real music coming from the attachments of random household items, such as fruit!! Will definitely purchase more :-) PS... this Xmas gift got almost as much attention as his new X Box!!!"
371,Bought it as a gift for my granddaughter who was introduced to this item at school.  Her birthday was just around the corner and she wanted one.  She likes it  - I’ve never seen it in action but appreciate the interest she showed in wanting one.  Very good example of hands-on learning for conductivity.
372,"While my 13-yo son didn't continue to play with this over the next year, he certainly enjoyed it for a few months.  I loved that it contained everything he needed for creative, educational ""wow"" factor right on Christmas morning.  So, great Christmas gift!"
373,"The Makey Makey is a great way to introduce someone to the world of electronics. The possibilities with this thing are endless. From music to games and much more the Makey Makey provides an interactive medium that makes learning about STEM and electronics fun at all ages. It is easy to set up, there are a bunch of guides out there on different applications, and skills you will learn while using this could allow you to further your skills to more challenging projects."
374,My son used it for a school project.
375,Love that my grandchildren were induced to create and learn from this small package!
376,Outstanding product. So easy and so much fun for the kids while they learn about technology. A top pick for STEM products. Can be accessed using SCRATCH programming. And can be expanded by adding Arduino piggy back board to make limitless projects.STEM Project shown features Makey Makey GO integrated to Art.... This is STEAM project. Mayor Tecklenberg of Charleston SC shown with young inventor.
377,My 8 yr old granddaughter is a digital leader at school where they already use Makey Makey. This was my Christmas gift to her so she can work at home as well. The first thing she did was get it up and running and showing the older generations what fun coding can be!
378,"If this wasn't, it certainly should have been on the top gift list.  It makes the user think outside of the box and has endless possibilities.  My 15 year old son uses this often, and my 7 year old usually tags along for the fun.  It even blew the mind of my 18 year old nephew.  So much to do with this toy.  I highly recommend it."
379,My son loves it!!!  I wish it was a bit bigger than what it was though.
380,"This works as promised, but the well made marketing video rather over sells the amount of fun that can be had from converting everyday objects into computer keys. My Children (aged 11 and 14) got this for Christmas, played with it once for an hour and haven't touched it since. So quite a lot of money to pay for not very much electronics. Perhaps if your children are more into programming it would be more of a success."
381,"Such a clever and fun way to help teach computer, engineering, coding skills to kids and instill confidence in them. You will want to get a graphite pencil for other ways to explore and use the makey makey board."
382,"Excellent supplier. It arrived very quickly.My 9 year old loves the kit and has made lots of fun games. It's a great extension of scratch & the perfect interface  from coding to real life, as you can connect it to fruit etc.  There are lots of helpful online tools."
383,Just wanted to rest test it out for a little while before writing a review. It works great! Once you get the hang of how it works. I used it to build a family fued buzzer everyone loves it. And it shipped fast. Thanks seller!
384,"This was hours of fun for both my husband and 5 year old daughter, I am sure they will go back to it a lot as there are many options to increase the difficulty level based on your child's interests and abilities. I am not sure who liked it more, my husband or my daughter ;)"
385,"Allora, allora.Arrivato integro, completo di tutti i cavetti ad alligatore ed anche quelli più' piccoli bianchi, nella confezione originale e completo di istruzioni e stickers.Spedizione ovviamente sempre al top, arrivato anche un giorno prima rispetto alla data che era scritta sul tracking.Consiglio vivamente l'acquisto !!!!!!"
386,"J'ai acheté ce produit pour l'anniversaire de mon mari et de mon fils de 2 ans et demi.Tous les 2 ont adoré pouvoir jouer des instruments avec une banane, carotte, pâte à modeler ou tout autre objet.Ils débutent mais je suis convaincue que prochainement, leur imagination sera sans limite.Je conseille beaucoup le Makey Makey pour faire une activité adulte / enfant."
387,My son has wanted this for a long time. Christmas Day gone I don’t think he’s picked it up. Well advertised but really it’s not very exciting
388,"I bought this for my 8-year-olds. The ""turn objects/water into a piano"" aspect is amazingly awesome and super cool! But now we're a bit stuck figuring out what to do NEXT with it. (I admit that may say more about me than the product!!)"
389,This kit was purchased for my son and my daughter! Both are 10 and spend many hours creating with it. I love that it's semi electric and my daughter has just as much of an interest in it as my son. It's easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise!
390,Really fun.
391,
392,Such a fun item!  I use this at school with students!  They are always intrigued and impressed.  They learn a lot too!
393,It's fun...until it's not. Kids lost interest in it real fast. It isn't practical to setup buckets of water and play Dance Dance Revolution in the yard. Kids nowadays don't find Super Mario or Pacman entertaining.
394,"My granddaughter asked for this for Christmas.  I wasn't too sure about it.  There doesn't seem to be much to it.  But so far she is really enjoying it and learning from it.  I did get her an extra set of alligator clip leads to go with it tho, like some previous reviewers suggested."
395,"It works with my son's little figures. For some reason, it intermittently doesn't respond when I try it."
396,Exactly as described- lots of fun for young and old.
397,"Super cool, my kids love it.  Great for boys creativity with technology."
398,"At my University I gave this to students. They had so much fun that,  well, I'm not getting it back anytime soon. The beauty of this is it's not some prepackaged toy that limits imagination, it opens the imagination. There is more fun and learning in this tiny rectangle than a week ay Disney World."
399,"The Makey Makey is great!  I was able to build the project I wanted to make with ease.  It also got me more interested in Arduino's, and I've picked up a bunch of them now!  Great tool to start learning more about electronics."
400,Such a cool way for kids to learn about electricity and coding all in one! My kids learned neat concepts and some went home and bought them to use at home.
401,Mmm it's OK.  Very expensive for what you get.
402,"For starters, the alligator clips are covered with a plastic/rubber substance for safety from electric shock.  However, the substance is so slippery, it is quite difficult to actually press the clips open in order to make a connection.  The box states for 8 and up; I am considerably older than 8 and have good dexterity in my fingers.  It took me about five minutes to open and hold open the clips to make the connection.  Perhaps a less greasy feeling substance would be beneficial. (???)"
403,Very engaging for students!
404,"Joylabz is an excellent company.  Great customer service and great communication.  The Makey Makey product is stellar, and now with version 1.2, remapping the unit is quick & easy.  Very happy with my purchase."
405,"The things we do for our kids, I was expecting a good size kit, picture if you will a 5"" by 3"" note card, this measures 4 3/4"" by 3"", smaller that a note card, I hope my grandson likes it I paid, $54.48, I'm disappointed,picture are sometimes deceiving, hopefully he likes it!!"
406,"Great idea, the only reason I returned it was because the ends of white wires broke inside of the asdf ports rendering it useless :-( My kids were really into it when it worked though."
407,What fun....need to get classes to use it now I have learned how to!
408,Nice toy for children and it works very effectively
409,"My grand-daughter likes it, but grandma thinks it is way over priced for what it is!!!"
410,My granddaughter wanted this and seems to really like it.
411,Incredibly fun and easy to use! I can't wait for my students to get creative with Makey Makey.
412,kid lost interest fast...
413,"Tip top!Merci @rivages électroniquesSinon cette bête de courses, jamais je ne l'aurait connue !!"
414,My 10yo son got the Makey Makey for Xmas and is now using the device and playdoh to play Minecraft.  He loves it!
415,"El dispositivo llegó bien empaquetado y protegido, pero:- El hardware estaba defectuoso. Una de las conexiones no funcionaba en absoluto. No soy torpe con los dispositivos, los cables estaban bien (se probaron con otras conexiones y funcionaban).- No se indicaba la versión de Makey-Makey. Una es programable desde el software de arduino y la otra a través de una web de ellos que simplifica la cosa pero no te permite hacer mucho más que lo que hay allí. Yo pregunté acerca de la versión antes de comprarlo y no recibí respuesta. Era la segunda y para mí fue una decepción. Lo devolví a través de Amazon y aún estoy esperando la devolución del dinero, que ya he reclamado dos veces y espero esté efectiva en breve.En cuanto al dispositivo es muy divertido para trabajar con niños o si estás interesado en hacer alguna instalación artística (si tienes la primera versión). Pienso comprar otro que espero esta vez esté en buen estado."
416,Still working on this!
417,"Does not work as well as it seems. We connected the cables to some things and not all of them worked. you end up having to touch the metal parts of the cords to make it work. When it does work, it is pretty cool."
418,Parfait pour initier de manière ludique les enfants et les parents à l'informatique et à l’électricité.Quelques recherches sur internet et on trouve plein d'appli compatible pour passer des heures à s'amuser.En l'associant à un rapsburry les possibilités sont infinies.
419,"This was an unnecessary purchase on my part, but it's really cool!"
420,i always wanted a banana that would turn on my chromecast!
421,Cute idea but a bit gimmicky....kids got tired of it quickly.
422,Perfect
423,"This is the coolest toy, my son loves it"
424,It kept my grandson happy for tree days
425,Did not entertain very long.  Could have spent less for something that could do more
426,Silly and hilarious.  But also great to use with Scratch - it delighted my class.
427,A wonderfully straight-forward way to explore STEM/STEAM projects.
428,its great
429,A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+
430,So much fun!
431,So cool
432,Disappointed in this  it is a tiny box and is not worth the money.
433,One defect sensor if all five were working it would be a steal offer but ok atleast i avoided travelling 40km for these sensors if u have a electrinic shop near by you dont even consider this product you will save time and money
434,ultrasonic sensor not working properly
435,"All the sensors are of poor quality except Ultrasonic sensor.For other sensors either there is range issue, or sensor does not work as expected.Not worth the money as you will be mostly be disappointed to do anything with these useless sensors."

439,Just awesome....  All materials required provided inside the package. Good quality product. But disappointed 😞 with a few things :1. The chassis of the robot had a big crack on its rear end.  [The package should have been marked handle with care]2. The motors don't come prepared wired.They could have soldered the wires to the motor instead of just giving them loose.Otherwise happy with the product.Although not tested the robot using the code...
440,"Overall is good,, but i recieved the chassis in a broken condition and not all screws and bolts were present neither jumper wires were there as shown in the picture..Did not go into any replacement coz it is a very time consuming process"
441,The vendor is useless. The video is of no use as instruction given are not appropriate for building the Line follower. The instruction provided are too less for creating the same. The worst part is so said instruction paper is so dim printed that it is hard to understand. I would not recommend the buy from the buyer.
442,"No instructions purely Chinese product of low quality.Definitely not for kids of any age.Person with knowledge of pi/Arduino can assemble it after spending a full day.Please do not buy , my app is not allowing to upload photograph or else I could have shown."
443,Item good but programmed is not mentioned this item that he is not work....

456,Very good product. Good packaging. A good box also. Very important for beginners.
457,"This kit contains all the sensors mentioned. All 38 of them. Could do finitely infinite experiments with them. All of them are well packed. The only thing is, I received the kit with items arranged in a different order than it is mentioned in the sheet. Took a while to arrange them. Apart from them, GO BUT IT. It's absolutely worth it."
458,"It contains most of the sensors, but not all the sensors work correctly and few sensors mentioned in the sheet are different from the one I got so, do not buy for a specific sensor buy so you can have lots of sensors :)"
459,Gave it as a gift to my 10 year son on his birthday. He was very happy and now he is spending in researching them..Very useful to kids who has interest in these type of experiments
460,Very good product in low price.
461,Just FAULTY!!
462,"Bought it for my son, he gives 5 stars"

473,"Yet to use this sensor kit, it would have helped if the data sheets or a link to download them."
474,Great
475,Has all products .
476,Ok
477,"Worst product I have seen in Amazon. Two motor cases are broken and one motor does not contain the strap. Speaking of wheel it's not like the wheel in their picture, poor quality. Don't go for this item. Waste for this cost."
478,Ok

480,No standard Shaft Hole..
481,Ok ok
482,GOOD
483,I was very disappointed with the tyres the three products were same and the fourth one was another model
484,2 wheels are having damaged tyres...
485,Worthless.
486,Good but not with hard case
487,"The product quality and application is very good, a must buy, got just for 464 and a 2 day delivery ¡!!!!!"
488,Vallue for money
489,Very good as per expectation. The product is good. Reduced 1 star as we were expecting better rubber for tire. But the product we received is serving the purpose.
490,I used this for making a robot and it worked so well. The wheels are also thick enough and are madeof good quality rubber. It is worth of money. Don't think just buy
491,But a little too expensive

496,Well good product at cheap price.
497,Works well
498,The wheels are pretty bad wulith 2 of them not staying on the motor shaft. Very cheap plastics tuff being sold as components to buil a robot!!
499,Have to be tested ? Appears to be good.
500,Super
501,best product
502,Jumpers missing
503,The product is amazing. I liked very much. But 2 things were missing.
504,car goes in uneven direction
505,Few spacers screws and nuts are missing. Looks like careless to inspect befire shipping.
506,"Amazing build quality and final built up kit , as a point of improvment if the holes on the chassis can have standard mounting configuration for an Arduino or a raspberry pie etc then this will be perfect"
507,There no battery holder and the chassis top n bottom plates size mis-matching. With this it’s hard to assemble the product
508,Amazing 👌 productEverything is okIn very good priceFully satisfied
509,A very nice product.All necessary things were provided.
510,"I didn't receive the exact number of items as described by the seller in the description. I got only wheels and motors. Chassis, screws, etc were missing. So I returned the product back."
511,Good

521,"It's good product,  my project 6.2kg this wheel easily carry my project ! This item is good for small robor car ,Under 6.5 kg"
522,"Yeahh they are kind of good. Works perfectly for me, just i have to find something so that these fit in my round axel motor perfectly.The conditions were good, all portions were perfect.4 stars because i think 100 rs. Per piece is a bit high."
523,Overpriced with respect to the quality of the material.
524,Normal grip
525,I don't have received the raspberry Pi 4 so I can't inform about it
526,"There is no issue with this board but it costs 16,000 incl. gst but in robu silverline and other official sites its only 7000 to 8000. they are out of stock so you increaced the price?"
527,"Nice to have RaspberryPi but due to scarcity, the price is high. Idk whether its new or used (it’s my 1st R’Pi). It sure works fine."
528,A very versatile product for my DIY project but the shortage of chips in market made me buy this product at a premium. But my project was a success
529,"This little board is capable of doing as much as almost any full-size laptop or desktop computer. Plug in your USB keyboard and mouse then hook up to your HDMI monitor and you'll then be using a new mini computer running on a Linux-based OS that can be built out and programmed by you to control just about anything you want. With plenty of documentation and sample projects available it's pretty easy to create new products like others are already doing.Expensive item.But not easy to find in stock.For me, it’s worth itNot much to say here. It's the pi so you know it's good. If you're buying this then you already know what you're getting."
530,"If you are tech. enthusiast then it is good to have this product. I initially bought this Pi to just flex on Linux environment but I later I realized that it can be used many electronics projects.But, I believe Pi don't have analog I/O. So, please consider this before using it in your project.Although, I am not a tech geek but I think it is ""good to go"" product for those who want to start working on Linux or want to learn Linux but are afraid of messing up.

545,It is best but prise is very high
546,"Such huge prize, i can't affordable.why this high price, before it only cost below six thousand. Why they selling huge price. I'm a student. I think mostly it buy by students of engineering. Someone are jobless. Then this price range can't buy. also demand of the product too decrease. Now some student changes to Arduino."
547,"The delivery was fast and the packaging was good. If you're planning to use it without a dedicated monitor, be sure to change the display resolution to max using PuTty or else you won't be able to get any display in VNC viewer.. Also, I would've been even more happy if the product came with its power adapter. I had to buy a 5V3A adapter from a store near me to get this on. That's the only small disappointment I had."
548,Its a quality product everything works fine and this tiny SBC has lots of power in it so I would recommend go for it but buy the 8gb version only if you really required it for your specific work or else 4gb will be the ideal for average person as you won’t notice any major benefits of the 8gb using the raspberry pi os 32 bit  but anyway if you bought it I would recommend you to use manjaro in it it works flawlessly
549,"A good product for tinkering or plain and simple utility like a home media server or data server.However did not understand what was the reason for sneaking MS Repos in Raspbian OS...Hence, ditched Raspbian and switched to Manjaro."
550,value for money
551,Good product
552,"This product not replace you desktop butBest product for students, online work & programing....Price is too high on AmazonAll over product is bestThank you 😊 raspberry & amazon"
553,"The product is not booting up.......seriously upset with it. Been trying to set it up but it seems the pi sent to me is faulty. Unfortunately, the day to return had passed; I was busy and couldn't check the date to return. Now I feel betrayed and lost my hard-earned money."
554,The product is genuine and is from Element 14. Thanks.
555,It’s very good product. And I need more.
556,Good product but rate too high
557,"I have been using pi 3b + earlier and this is my 2nd purchase of pi, this time - pi 4.  Liked it."
558,"E6 is nice..But if you are buying first time in so please buy full-kit [ Raspberry pi, Power Adapter, SD Card, And a HDMI cable ].Because Without These Basic Components Your Can't use it."
559,"Though the outer box which shipped was sealed and secured fairly well, the raspberry PI box was not. the seal was already broken and the box did look a bit man-handled. A piece of tape was holding the box together. The pi seems to be working fine and all the contents are present in the box."
560,It is a very good product. I love to work on pi. This pi4 B with 4GB i bought is indeed fast and good. Proper case to hold heat sinks and fan should be made available which can help to keep the pi4 cooler and efficient for long working hours. I am truly enjoying working on this pi4.
561,The SD card slot had problems right from the beginning. Actually I thought it was the SD card with raspbian thatbwas the problem. I could boot from another raspbian installation on another SD card. Now after 7onths the slot is dead. Tried with new eeprom. Doesn't work. Boots only from usb
562,at Amazon expensive than others
563,PRICE IS LITTLE BIT HIGHER. But thank God it is available atleast here
564,"It's really worth for the money you spending on , good product."
565,"This is a wonderful product, but buying from Amazon is a mistake.It's being sold by sellers who have their own website, and sell for cheaper there. Also, my RasPi had a faulty hardware and returning it is a nightmare.I wanted replacement, but that's not possible and 2 people have come for return and say they cannot as they are not authorised. What does that even mean?I'm getting aweful wifi speeds on this even with 5ghz network"
566,Working fine..... Excellent
567,Very good
568,Nice
569,"i need a secondary computer for some web development works1. Bought it.2. Installed rasbberry pi OS (debian)3. Installed apache,php,mysql4. installed filezila5. Runs perfectlyI recommend this to all LAMP developer. i do a lot of wordpress development on this ."
570,Genuine and functional rpi4. No issues.
571,it's good but if you are going to use it get some heatsinks for it if you want it to last longer and a protective case to avoid damaging any pins
572,Good
573,Good
574,So far all so good! 🤓
575,"Wonderful item for hobbyist and basic users. Can be easily used as a small desktop computer by adding a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse. An external HDD will be a welcome addition."
576,"Not working. red light on not blinking ,no green light. 'Signal not detected ' message in hdmi display it is within one year period."
577,Well seller is selling this from thinkbits which cost nearly 4700/- for 4GB variant.
578,"If you are seeing this product, you must already know about the raspberry pi.This is excellent single board computer.You must use heatsink for this model otherwise you it will damage."
579,Good
580,"Hdmi ports are not punctioning, useless"
581,"A good product meant for people who want basic computer operations higher to what a mobile does,without investing mo ey in a laptop/desktop"
582,The product was not working.
583,"At this price, please buy a NUC or SFF PC. Raspberry Pi is good if it costs $35 to $50. If you spend more than that, the price for performance is way too less. For this price, You can easily get a used CPU with minimum core i5 processor, gives more value for this ₹13,499.00. If you're focus is to use only the GPIO pins, I'm sure you don't need a computer with 2 to 8 GB RAM. purchase a pi 2040 or any ESP board or Arduino boards. Again, DON'T buy this at above price."
584,"Can run kali,ubuntu and other operating systems."
585,Overpriced by 2000 rupees.
586,Better process power than the previous version
587,"I hope no one buys it at this price. When the prices drop, these sellers will be left with sucking the short end of their own stick."
588,Good
589,Great little tool to learn and lab things out. Excellent learning opportunity for kids and a powerful prototyping environment for adults.The rates are way to expensive right now. wait for the shortages to end. The price should be a lot lower
590,bad product and also is costly
591,Its sowth koria made virsion not itali made product sholdering is cheep. micro HDMI ports not labled yellow. Dont know it will run or not.very diapointed already over priced ...but amazon give second class item for a primioum price tag its not expected
592,Good working
593,It’s a horrible device stopped booting within a month. Then boots sometimes and shuts down in 10 minutes. Will also destroy you SD card. Amazon claims there’s no warranty on this item though manufacturer mentions 1 year warranty.
594,The best pi yet. Lowest price on Amazon
595,"Superb product. Very good performance for the price. Gets hot quickly, so a cooling fan is necessary."
596,Nice product
597,Don't even think of buying at this price very costly.  .  .  . . . . . . . .
598,Seems Ram is fake.I could find out today only.Please initiate return.Want replacement
599,Genuine
600,Great product i got for lowest possible price during sell.
601,Good
602,Very good deal
603,Mrp is very less but I bought in 17thousend
604,Excellent..
605,"For installation , cable connection no detail is availableTo work on it we face lot of problem to start"
606,(Device NOT Work)
607,Not working
608,I am using it as a backup device of my laptop. The noob has all the standard ability of a full fledged Ubuntu machine. Mounted in an official case with official cooling fan. Using VNC to view the output on my android mobile. You can use any webcam that is compatible with ubuntu. Superb model however price here is 1.5 times of the regular market price.
609,
610,Poor very poor it is very useless things don't by it it is waste of your money so dont buy
611,Prodect is very best work operating but rs cost very high plz price lo  information sellingWork is very good frformence
612,Brings down temperature really well. From mid 70s it's down to mid 40s. Maximum temperature I have seen on an over clocked pi is 50 degree Celsius.Fans are silent and make no noise. A bit tricky to figure out how to fit the case as it comes with no instructions but you can find videos on YouTube.
613,This is great product for mini projects and even big projects for industry prototypes.I bought this raspberry pi 4 8gb for my final year project.
614,"If you compare the price with official distributor price, it is on higher side and yes I am comparing after adding 18% GST"
615,Too expansive it's available in the market for 3200 pi4 2gb and other models also less thn that 4gb 8gb
616,"Over priced , original cost for this specs is  ₹ 4000 ."
617,Good product

669,"Wonderful item for hobbyist and basic users. Can be easily used as a small desktop computer by adding a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse. An external HDD will be a welcome addition."
670,"Not working. red light on not blinking ,no green light. 'Signal not detected ' message in hdmi display it is within one year period."
671,Well seller is selling this from thinkbits which cost nearly 4700/- for 4GB variant.
672,"If you are seeing this product, you must already know about the raspberry pi.This is excellent single board computer.You must use heatsink for this model otherwise you it will damage."
673,Good
674,"Hdmi ports are not punctioning, useless"
675,"A good product meant for people who want basic computer operations higher to what a mobile does,without investing mo ey in a laptop/desktop"
676,The product was not working.
677,"At this price, please buy a NUC or SFF PC. Raspberry Pi is good if it costs $35 to $50. If you spend more than that, the price for performance is way too less. For this price, You can easily get a used CPU with minimum core i5 processor, gives more value for this ₹13,499.00. If you're focus is to use only the GPIO pins, I'm sure you don't need a computer with 2 to 8 GB RAM. purchase a pi 2040 or any ESP board or Arduino boards. Again, DON'T buy this at above price."
678,"Can run kali,ubuntu and other operating systems."
679,Overpriced by 2000 rupees.
680,Better process power than the previous version
681,"I hope no one buys it at this price. When the prices drop, these sellers will be left with sucking the short end of their own stick."
682,Good
683,Great little tool to learn and lab things out. Excellent learning opportunity for kids and a powerful prototyping environment for adults.The rates are way to expensive right now. wait for the shortages to end. The price should be a lot lower
684,bad product and also is costly
685,Its sowth koria made virsion not itali made product sholdering is cheep. micro HDMI ports not labled yellow. Dont know it will run or not.very diapointed already over priced ...but amazon give second class item for a primioum price tag its not expected
686,Good working
687,It’s a horrible device stopped booting within a month. Then boots sometimes and shuts down in 10 minutes. Will also destroy you SD card. Amazon claims there’s no warranty on this item though manufacturer mentions 1 year warranty.
688,The best pi yet. Lowest price on Amazon
689,"Superb product. Very good performance for the price. Gets hot quickly, so a cooling fan is necessary."
690,Nice product
691,Don't even think of buying at this price very costly.  .  .  . . . . . . . .

699,"For installation , cable connection no detail is availableTo work on it we face lot of problem to start"
700,(Device NOT Work)
701,Not working
702,I am using it as a backup device of my laptop. The noob has all the standard ability of a full fledged Ubuntu machine. Mounted in an official case with official cooling fan. Using VNC to view the output on my android mobile. You can use any webcam that is compatible with ubuntu. Superb model however price here is 1.5 times of the regular market price.
703,
704,Poor very poor it is very useless things don't by it it is waste of your money so dont buy
705,Prodect is very best work operating but rs cost very high plz price lo  information sellingWork is very good frformence
706,Brings down temperature really well. From mid 70s it's down to mid 40s. Maximum temperature I have seen on an over clocked pi is 50 degree Celsius.Fans are silent and make no noise. A bit tricky to figure out how to fit the case as it comes with no instructions but you can find videos on YouTube.
707,This is great product for mini projects and even big projects for industry prototypes.I bought this raspberry pi 4 8gb for my final year project.
708,"If you compare the price with official distributor price, it is on higher side and yes I am comparing after adding 18% GST"
709,Too expansive it's available in the market for 3200 pi4 2gb and other models also less thn that 4gb 8gb
710,"Over priced , original cost for this specs is  ₹ 4000 ."
711,Good product
712,Just nice
713,Just a regular pi camera
714,Works fine with my RPi4. Picture quality is very average but cannot complain at this price.
715,Never worked for me even while changing the wires. I just got a regular USB camera and it was perfect for the job.
716,this is a good camera for rasberry pi 3 projects. when i got the camera though i was not able to take videos it would just show a black screen.
717,"The camera is really great, No doubt about that. I just have one question and I would be glad if someone could help me with a solution. For my project we are making a self driving rc car. But the recording video, the video is too shaky, How do I enable video stabilization to overcome this issue?Thank you in advance!"
718,What else can you get for ₹366?It's a 5 MP shooter. Good field of view.
719,I bought it for my project on home security system and only used it to capture images.The image quality was good considering the price.But the real problem is you should be careful while connecting it to Pi.Remember to power off the Pi before connection.If not then you'll damage the sensor and then it's just useless.Remember to turn off Pi before connection!!!!🙂 Coz I roasted my camera by not turning off the PI
720,I am working on a project so I urgently need this product I got it delivered in 1day i like it and it's was working fine no issues. Overall good product.
721,"This is a good camera but delicate, i am ordering second time, first camera sensor got damaged  due to to hand handling, most likely static discharge, also when i tried to remove lense cover to take out IR filter its not working anymore... Strange i did.very carefully"
722,i bought this camera for making time-lapses during 3D printing using Octolapse... this is  affordable camera for such projects. I found it very useful.

733,Broo i loved it soo much the best packaging experience i ever had. the camera was in extreme quality and the box had soo much warmth to it . I loved the product and i really would recommend to everyone searching for a raspberry pi cam. The quote on the top was kinda heartwarming.It has a good value for money too
734,"I do not know if this is actually 5MP, but the image quality is not that great. For simple and fun projects with a Raspberry Pi, it is worth the money.If you are looking to make a security camera with your Pi, this will not be effective. But otherwise, it's okay.  A fun addition to your electronics DIY kit."
735,best at the price under 500
736,Camera works fine. But consider fact that Raspberry Pi developers are deprecating support for older hardware in newer versions of RPi OS!
737,value for money
738,Not usable for pi zero properly
739,Good product
740,
741,good nice capture
742,It's working as expected. The quality is also good. Value for money. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery and the quality products.
743,Value for money
744,"The product came in a nice small box. Worked perfectly with the raspberry pi 3. Photo quality is what you can expect of a 5 MP and video is also not so bad. Finally, a good product at 500."
745,good product....better clarity of video than imagined
746,"Works as expected.Easy for installation, picture quality is also above expectation.The only thing which is missing is the RPi Zero cable, they must include that in the package, as you'll have to buy this separately if you wanna use it in RPi Zero"
747,Got the delivery on time.Needed it to setup motionOS on pi3b. Works great
748,"At an affordable cost, the RPI camera comes in very good packaging. It's so easy to test it as well in just few minutes. The picture quality is very good and you can make any DIY projects involving taking pictures or video. Came earlier than the original dates."
749,"Since it can be programmed in Python, the possibilities are endless."
750,initially just testing if it worked
751,Not worrhy. Blurred image. Very hard to comply
752,It's photos and videos are nice qualily
753,For this price its have acceptable image and video quality with Rpi
754,"It is very good, but it is not compatible with the device"
755,"Gives very good, sharp images and video is also very clear. Very happy with the purchase."
756,Just plug in the camera and run the service on terminal and voila the camera works.
757,Good for practice and i used this for raspberry robot which can stream video from mobile robot which i can control via html
758,Good
759,The camera is actually 2.07 MP. Feeling like cheated.
760,The product is faulty and not working. Amazon does not replace it either.
761,Excellent product no issue
762,Even though it works well on testing.....I can't connect camera with Google meet ...That Google meet not found the camera ....... Please help me
763,"Product does not work with Jetson Nano,returned the product."
764,Beat product for this price range and if you want more quality than go with the hihger version available.
765,Works great. Value for money.
766,Works fine with the latest rpi4 version.Good quality 👍 at this price.
767,I liked the product. I have been using it for my project and faced no issue.
768,light not showing up .....too expensive
769,Good camera. Works fine
770,Good
771,Iv been using it for 2 months now without any issues. The image quality is good as well
772,Works like a charm. Just make sure you have some kind of housing for it.
773,I don't know that the received product is working or not mine is RPI 4 b model when I setup with camera module it doesn't work so I returned the product
774,Good working
775,Quality is not good
776,It's awesome product  it is value for money
777,Replaced product was good and working
778,"The camera module simply didnt work. Tried following all remedies found online (tried refixing the connector, updating the pi 4 etc). It simply doesnt connect.On the other hand, I can simply plugin a webcam thru the pi USB and that workedHence this camera module is the issue"
779,More effective motion pictures can be shot. Nice camera
780,"Camera sensor is not responding ,and thows error -  please check all connections including sunny one in the board ""-> i have checked the connection and tried in another pi 3 too"
781,"Camera quality is very bad,I know the price is less but the pictures are not clear even in very low resolution. Pictures are pixelated. I placed a return request with 10minutes of using it."
782,Good to buy
783,Doesn't work!!! Sunny sensor is fixed loose. Couldn't receive data from sunny sensor!! Don't buy this product.. I couldn't even return this.
784,Camera quality is good for price!
785,"Good , easy to operate.No replacement required."
786,"Its Not working. On connecting camera module properly and when switching on rpi 4 model b, smoke is coming out from rpi board near display port."
787,It is not working properly. Could you please replace this product
788,Over priced as item is available outside market for Rs 290. Working as expected

802,It's cheaper than other sites and works comfortably with my raspberry pi 3 model B.
803,Surely recommend !
804,I have used Raspberry pi 5MP camera board and it is very nice. Great product and works well with Raspberry Pi.
805,"It works very well with raspberry pi zero w, can record flawlessly. Lighting should be good , low light photos are noisy but can't expect much at this price."
806,Quality of the product is really good with expected picture quality.
807,Works as expected.
808,"This is the ""official"" Raspberry Pi camera, and it works pretty well for what it is-- small, relatively inexpensive, and easy to set up.However,  I'm not using it anymore.  I set up OctoPrint for my 3D printer and wanted to use the timelapse feature.  This camera works and image quality is ok, but there are mounting issues that you have to solve and the ok quality is just that-- only ok.  With only a little bit more configuration, I was able to set up OctoPrint with a Logitech c900 series USB webcam.  I was really surprised at just how easy it was to set up-- it seems that many USB cameras are basically at the plug-and-play level of compatibility with Raspbian.  I just needed to point OctoPrint's streaming service to the correct device, and it worked.Benefits of using a USB camera instead of this one:- Image quality can be much better (especially in low light),- Mounting is easier,- It's in a more rugged/sealed enclosure, and- Because USB cameras usually come with a cable attached, your Pi can be several feet away from the camera.  In my case, having the camera mounted to the print bed and placing the Pi a few feet away is a much nicer solution than I could have achieved with the official RPi Camera.Benefits of using THIS camera instead of USB:- If you want a camera and Pi integrated into the same case, this camera is probably the best (only) choice- Power consumption is probably lower.  (USB cameras might need to be connected to the Pi through a powered hub)- It is likely to be cheaper, depending on the USB camera that you're considering- In my experience, this camera was SLIGHTLY easier to set up (although USB camera setup was not really difficult at all)"
809,"QUICK SUMMARY:  Amazing steal for just a few bucks, with tons of potential for those motivated to learn.  Highly recommended!BACKGROUND:  I only came to the Raspberry Pi world a few months ago as of this writing, and quite by accident.  Originally, I bought just a Raspberry Pi to inspire my pre-teen son, but quickly got hooked myself.  Adding this camera to a Raspberry Pi made sense as it opens up a ton of creative opportunities and, for me specifically, helped me replace WiFi home surveillance cameras which no longer worked reliably following a company buy-out.WHAT I LIKE:- Inexpensive!  Add a 5MB camera for under thirty bucks?  Yes, please!- Easy to install!  Pop up a locking tab on the Raspberry Pi, insert the ribbon, lock the tab into place and, done!- Easy to immediately use!  I use the Picamera library and have had a lot of success using that to get photos- Add a wide-angle lens!  Sold separately, I bought a somewhat clunky wide-angle clip-on lens and greatly improved the utility of this camera- Great quality photos if you're taking outside shots in bright light; otherwise, they're okay (but great for the money spent)- Trouble-free.  I've bought three of these cameras for three Pi's and all are working reliably, even outdoors under my eavesWHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The camera comes with only one, default ribbon cable which for me is just barely long enough.  I'd prefer having ordering options where the customer could choose how long of a cable to go along with the camera board.  (Yes, you can buy ribbon cables separately, but that's at a greater cost and the shorter ribbon needlessly becomes a throw-away attachment).CONCLUSION:  Great item at an even greater value proposition.  Highly recommended!"
810,"Good camera, easy to setup and use, with surprisingly good image quality in daylight; however, after the latest software update, I was unable to get it to take still pictures any faster than one every 2.3 sec, whatever the size of the image and without any processing, despite what the documentation seems to imply. The video is fast enough, but that's not what I wanted.Also, it is **really** static-sensitive....A few months later:In his blog, Miguel Mota describes how to stream video from the Pi and it turns out that the stream is actually a sequence of jpeg pictures (about 10 per second). It is trivial to split this stream into individual pictures and to process them for motion detection. The limitation of still pictures to a very low rate clearly results from a defective software implementation."
811,"Worked as expected.  Not great in low light but it's about what you'd expect.  It is easy to hook up, easy to control from Python and worked with every demo bundled in Raspbian, The cable is very short.  You can buy a longer one from Adafruit for cheap, but they warn you that longer cables may have data corruption.  I haven't tried them.  I would like it if the board was more compact.  The CCD is a small portion of the board so I think this is doable.  The board is relatively heavy and doesn't like to be propped against anything.  You pretty much have to build a mount for it or hold it with your hands."
812,"Compacte et légère.Le câble ""ruban"", livré avec, peut être remplacé (déclipage - clipage) par un plus long pour avoir plus de souplesse de positionnement par rapport au Rasberry PI.Un boitier  ou support de protection est utile pour pouvoir la ""fixer"" quelque part.La mise en œuvre est facile. Plusieurs solutions, usages : timelapse avec la commande raspistill; détection de mouvement avec le package motion; ou prise de photos à la demande, via un programme à écrire en python, avec par exemple le package picamera.Les images sont de qualité. Le package picamera  intègre une commande preview qui permet de s'adapter à la luminosité avant la prise de photo."
813,Jury still out on this one - but that's more down to the PSU that is supplying the Raspberry. The PSU is a Maplin PSU rated at 2A but it results in lots of horizontal lines on the image. However when powered from my PC monitor USB port it runs well. It's a camera and it works with the Pi - just make sure you have a good PSU before blaming the camera like I did at first.
814,"Great camera for the price. Bought it for a raspberry pi security camera (made of Legos!) and it ended up working a lot better than I was expecting with motion. The specs as far as picture quality are as advertised.Be aware of the ribbon cable length, it seems to vary. The cable length isn't advertised and it seems to vary as I've seen reviews reporting 6"" length. Mine was a little under 3"" which was cutting it close for my project needs."
815,"I'm using this to monitor my 3d printer being run by a Raspberry Pi B+ with OctoPrint and it's just what I needed. I paired it with a lens meant for a cell phone (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C3CSXC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36) for an awesome fish eye view of my entire build platform, and a 3D printed enclosure to finish it off. There really isn't much to complain about this product, other than wishing the ribbon that came with it was slightly longer. I ended up purchasing a longer ribbon here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M4DAQH8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19 to better suit my needs. It's the simplest choice when dealing with a Rasperry Pi."
816,"In the right light, these pics are actually really good-looking! It's a bit awkward placing it just about anywhere, due to the thin cable, that shouldn't be bent. Would have been better to bunch all cables together in a tube, but doing that, you might as well get an old Webcam and hook it up over USB"
817,"Ich habe die Kamera gekauft, um damit eine kostengünstige Überwachungskamera zu realisieren. Die ersten Versuche mit dem Befehl ""raspistill"" und seinen zahlreichen Optionen lassen kaum Wünsche offen.Die Qualität der Bilder ist Spitze, vergleichbar mit einer Smartphone-Kamera.Beim Positionieren der Kamera stört das breite und auch etwas steife Flachbandkabel ein wenig, ich habe schon feinere Bänder in der Hand gehabt. Etwas enttäuschend ist die Lichtempfindlichkeit bei Dunkelheit, aber für den Preis sollte man darüber nicht meckern. Vielleicht gibt es bald eine Version ohne integrierten IR-Filter, so dass eine Ausleuchtung mit IR-Scheinwerfer bei Dunkelheit diese Schwäche kompensiert."
818,"So the Raspberry Pi Camera Module is a bit expensive but it integrates very well with the Pi and it means that I don't have to mess around with USB cameras. That time savings alone is worth the price. I wish the cable was a bit longer and that there was a housing of some kind included. A cheap case for the camera cost me another $5. But overall, the picture quality is great and there's built in support for capturing video and images. If only it was a bit cheaper."
819,"Honestly, the cam is great, but the ribbon cable can get annoying. If they made the ribbon cable turn into a single line that is easier to bend and maneuver, the world would be a better place.. And the way it connects by just sliding into a friction sandwich is kind of sketchy"
820,"The two pages on raspberrypi.org  that are supposed to lead to config and troubleshooting info lead to a picture of a confused pretty bird and a 404.After an inordinate amount of digging, it became apparent that motion-mmal downloaded in binary available at a couple of file share sites was the only viable solution as the OEM binary motion package did not work.It's late, I'm tired and cranky and I could have put the money to a more pleasurable use such as a nice scotch and just kept using my cheaper and better Logitech C170."
821,I pushed on the surface mount caps off its pads when I was making a mount for this camera. I re-soldered it on with a regular soldering iron and it works fine.  Excellent resolution works as expected. 4 starts because I was able to push a surface mount component off its pad with my finger.
822,"Camera was plug and play with my Pi and the only time I had an issue getting it to work was because the ribbon cable wasn't shoved in all the way or I had the cable flipped 180.It's a great little camera, and I'm especially thankful that it has a little red LED on it so I can tell right away if it's working."
823,"Good quality and worked out of the box. The only negative is that focusing it is difficult because the lens is glued into place, and I ended up scratching the plastic a lot to get it adjusted."
824,The picture quality from this camera is amazing during the day. Both video and stills are better than than I expected in good light. The only downside is that it requires a lot of light. During dusk and dawn the images are grainy. At night it is entirely unusable.
825,"The still images produced on this camera are really good.  A still shot takes about 6 seconds to process.  Camera operation from the command line is easy, and can be included in Python scripts and C/++ code.  One problem - the ribbon cable, which is never to be folded or creased, is folded and creased for packaging."
826,"Die Kamera funktioniert gut. Ich benutze sie um damit Green Screen Bilder tzu erstellen. Allerdings darf wirklich nicht zu wenig Licht im Raum sein. Dann sind die Bilder kaum noch zu gebrauchen. Der Anschluss an den Raspberry Pi gestaltet sich mit etwas Ruhe recht einfach. Während das Flachbankabel bereits an der Kamera ist, wird das andere Ende einfach an den Csi des Rpi angeschlossen. Minimale frimelarbeit für dicke Finger."
827,"Zumindest bei ordentlichem Licht macht dieses winzige Module echt gute Bilder.Die Anbindung an den Raspi ist wirklich kinderleicht und man kann sich die Mühe mit irgendwelchen WebCams sparen. Zumindest sehe ich außer dem längeren Kabel und potentiell mehreren Cams keinen Grund.Ob der Raspi neben der direkt angeschlossenen Cam noch weitere USB-Cams überhaupt performant abfragen kann, habe ich jetzt nicht mehr ausprobiert.Klare Empfehlung für Leute mit Spieltrieb und Interesse an schnellen, zuverlässigen Ergebnissen."
828,"Ormai il raspberry non è più una novità, comunque è sempre piacevole ritrovarsi con un oggetto essenziale, pratico e funzionale, soprattutto ad un prezzo decisamente accettabile ed alla portata di tutti.Il funzionamento di questo modulo è ineccepibile, semplice e veloce da installare e con una resa efficace.Dal momento che va installata sul Raspberry Pi, è consigliato avere un minimo di conoscenze del sistema Linux, o almeno avere qualche amico che in caso di necessità possa aiutare per riuscire a fare quello che vogliamo.Ottimo in tutto."
829,Works fine.Can buy them cheaper from outside Amazon along with specified cable lengths.
830,Très bon produits la qualité est vraiment super appréciable.je l'utilise en caméra de surveillance avec motionpie. Détection de mouvements avec cliché. J'en suis super content
831,"The connecting cable is a little cumbersome for a close mounting.  It works great both for video and photos.  If different cables were offered for more convenient mounting, it would be excellent."
832,"Qualité de l'image identique à celle attendue.Maintenant, faut se relever les manches et chercher la doc pour streamer la vidéo sur le web !"
833,Great quality pics that are streets ahead of old webcam i was using but feels very delicate.
834,I like it.  Make sure you position the blue end of the ribbon connector properly into the camera slot.  See the video at the Pi website.
835,Great for your pi projects. A must have
836,"Purchased with an outdoor camera enclosure, pi and misc parts to make an outdoor security camera.  This has a fantastic picture, able to read license plates of cars driving by.  Easily handles a smooth 30 fps.  Both thumbs up on this one."
837,Only drawback is that it doesn't have a mount... so be prepared to find one.
838,Camera works fine and seems to give good definition and colour balance.
839,my kid the computer science major asked for this for christmas.  i don't know what it does.  he says it doesn't blow up anything.  i'm hoping nobody official shows up at my door.
840,"The camera that works the best with the Raspberry Pi, and that doesn't take an extra USB.Just love it for most movement recognition features it supports!"
841,"El producto viene bien embalado y protegido por una bolsa antiestática.El precio es correcto y la cámara funciona sin problemas.Es recomendable comprar una carcasa para la cámara o fabricar un soporte casero para mantenerla en la posición deseada, sin ello no tiene ningún tipo de sujeción y es impracticable utilizarla de forma estable.No todas las carcasas están preparadas para su uso!"
842,"Buona Cam: la risoluzione è notevole e perfetta per il Raspberry: basta collegarla, abilitarla e installando un software di videosorveglianza, la rende molto utile. Necessita sicuramente di una cover utile per direzionarla come si desidera."
843,"I bought this to my husband for valentine's day, because he had been talking about it for a while. We have tried it and it's pretty cool, but we haven't yet explored all the options. So far, so good."
844,Be careful they are super fragile!
845,専用カメラモジュールということで購入しました。ただ、使ってみると、制約が多く、USB接続のWebCamの方が使いやすかった。まだ、使いこなせていないだけかもしれません。新しい発見があったら、評価　★＋１します。
846,"Fun camera. Easy to get a picture with ""raspistill -o filename.jpg"" at command prompt"
847,Brilliant! Easy to attach to the RasPi and to get functioning (thanks to the many tutorials available on the 'net). Provides many hours of entertainment.
848,Works
849,Does what I want just wish the cabling was more flexible for what I need.
850,Camera is setup to time lapse my 3D Printing and works well although wish it had a longer ribbon but knew that before ordering and also ordered a ribbon somewhere else.
851,Meet my expectations!
852,"Work well, even if the cable is a little short."
853,"Fonctionne correctement, il y a pas mal de grain si peu d'éclairage (pénombre) !Un peu compliqué a utiliser avec motion."
854,"The camera worked for a short time, after that the 'stuck at red light' bug that others have referred to. Returned it. camera is ultra sensitive to static, so be very careful."
855,Cámara de 5 Mpx. Conectar y listo. La cámara funciona muy bien con buena iluminación. Muy facil de instalar y de usar.
856,ラスベリーパイはUSB給電が貧弱なので、USB接続のカメラだと給電不足で不安定になったりします。専用モジュールはその点動作が安定していますし、映りもけっこう普通。画質設定も簡単です。基板むき出しで静電気の不安があるのとリボンケーブルの取り回しがちょっと面倒ですが、USB給電の事を考えるとこっちのほうが良いかと。
857,fun gadget
858,Very quick service and deliveryWill help me to develop my RPi astronomical photography projectJust need some 35mm film canisters to build the camera into to mount iton the telescope
859,Perfect
860,Works as advertised. Worked well with my pi and haven't had any abnormalities come up
861,Good cameras.
862,Worked fine
863,"It's a camera for the Rasberry Pi. It takes pictures and video. If you need a camera, get it."
864,"OK, this is a great addition to the Raspberry Pi. Will make a nice visual sensor for my robot. Was packed well and arrived as advertized, no issues."
865,they released the 8MP like a week after I bought this :(
866,I plug it in and it worked at first then after a day or two it just stopped.  I purchased two and its the same thing.
867,"buonissima cam per raspberry PI, la qualità di foto e video non è eccelsa ma, d'altronde, costa poco e non si può pretendere molto.ottima per chi vuole sperimentare la videosorveglianza con li pi."
868,"La camara tiene una definicion fantastica, tiene detector de movimiento y led. Le faltaría un microfono en mi opinion para ser completa."
869,Using with Motion Pie and Raspberry Pi 2 for security webcam.Simple to install and use-quick delivery!
870,Works great.  Using this along with a RPi 2 as a concealed security camera.
871,"garbage. took about 5 pictures and 1 video then died. no matter what i do it is undetectable. never exposed to shock, impact or temp. just sat on my desk. maybe a better solution to connect web cam to ur pi? this was just a waste of money"
872,pretty much plug and play. I suppose but I spend half my day in command line terminals anyway.  :D
873,"Attention na pas fonctionné avec mon b+, malgré des recherches approfondi, impossible de la faire détecté. Par contre marche parfaitement bien avec l'ancienne génération. Image de qualité."
874,War ein Geschenk vom Wunschzettel eines Freundes.Perfek für mich : nix falsches geschenktPerfekt für den beschenkten: der war voll zufrieden
875,Does what it says on the tin!  just as you'd expect - a good quality item.
876,Combind with some python you can do some cool time lapse
877,Just plugged it in and in minutes i was taking great pictures and video. Couldnt have been easier to set up.
878,"if you like to mess with things that are cranky and inconsistent, buy this. i invested a lot of time and research to no avail trying to get this thing to work as security cam dvr."
879,"This a great high res camera for all sorts of uses.  I,m using it to sharpen my video processing skills."
880,"Very finicky about connecting to the Raspberry PI, and it would sometimes just stop working. I eventually gave up on using it to monitor my pet turtle and used an old phone instead."
881,great product and works as well as I expected. Great fun to be had here.
882,The camera was somehow glued-on the board.  The glue dried out and the camera came off.  Gave it two-stars because the cost was reasonable.
883,Module did not work despite testing on multiple Pis. Returned for refund.
884,"La camara es buena, y da una calidad excelente, hay sin embargo varios metodos para hacer el streaming y cada uno de ellos tiene sus limitaciones, requiere saber usarla y calibracion para adaptarse al proyecto que queramos hacer"
885,"ottimo prodotto,lo consiglierei a coloro che intendono realizzare piccoli impianti di videosorveglianza o scattare foto in serie.Personalmente ho utilizzato questo articolo per la realizzazione del progetto di maturità che consisteva in un autovelox"
886,Compact and adds to versatility if the platform.
887,"Does the job, great little camera"
888,Good bit of kit. works well on all my Pi set ups.
889,"La qualité de la caméra est acceptable.Le seul hic : si je touche la partie noir de la caméra, elle s'éteint et je suis obligé de redémarrer le raspberry."
890,"Quick good shipping and working camera, what more is there to say?"
891,Works well with the Raspberry Pi I have it attached to
892,Received on time and as advertised.
893,Raspberry Piにつないだ時ぶらぶらするので、プラスティックの小箱に固定しました。思っていたより広角な写真が取れました。監視カメラなどいろいろ応用を考えていくのが、楽しみです。
894,"Die Kamera liefert nur bei heller Umgebung akzeptable Bilder. Sobald es etwas dunkler wird, rauscht es, das Bild wird matschig. Eine gewisse Unschärfe ist jedoch immer dabei. Lieber das Geld in eine etwas bessere Webcam stecken und weniger fluchen."
895,Perfect for my second PI using Octoprint on a 3D printer.
896,brother loves it
897,not greatest pic quality but works
898,excellent easy install.
899,Great camera for the Raspberry Pi.
900,Great product. Great price. Arrived quickly.
901,Great
902,"Works great, takes great photos"
903,As expected
904,"una telecamera di altissimo livello, ha solo un difetto, ma questo ddipende dal softwer di videosorveglianza ""Motion"" non si  puo usare la sua piena risoluzione, ma bisogna ""castrarla"" a una risoluzione max 1024x567 a 5 fps"
905,set up camera....nice and easy plug in.
906,Excellent value for money. Great picture quality.
907,ZOMG PONIES🦄🦄🦄🦄

941,It is best but prise is very high
942,"Such huge prize, i can't affordable.why this high price, before it only cost below six thousand. Why they selling huge price. I'm a student. I think mostly it buy by students of engineering. Someone are jobless. Then this price range can't buy. also demand of the product too decrease. Now some student changes to Arduino."
943,"The delivery was fast and the packaging was good. If you're planning to use it without a dedicated monitor, be sure to change the display resolution to max using PuTty or else you won't be able to get any display in VNC viewer.. Also, I would've been even more happy if the product came with its power adapter. I had to buy a 5V3A adapter from a store near me to get this on. That's the only small disappointment I had."
944,Its a quality product everything works fine and this tiny SBC has lots of power in it so I would recommend go for it but buy the 8gb version only if you really required it for your specific work or else 4gb will be the ideal for average person as you won’t notice any major benefits of the 8gb using the raspberry pi os 32 bit  but anyway if you bought it I would recommend you to use manjaro in it it works flawlessly
945,"A good product for tinkering or plain and simple utility like a home media server or data server.However did not understand what was the reason for sneaking MS Repos in Raspbian OS...Hence, ditched Raspbian and switched to Manjaro."
946,value for money
947,Good product
948,"This product not replace you desktop butBest product for students, online work & programing....Price is too high on AmazonAll over product is bestThank you 😊 raspberry & amazon"
949,"The product is not booting up.......seriously upset with it. Been trying to set it up but it seems the pi sent to me is faulty. Unfortunately, the day to return had passed; I was busy and couldn't check the date to return. Now I feel betrayed and lost my hard-earned money."
950,The product is genuine and is from Element 14. Thanks.
951,It’s very good product. And I need more.
952,Good product but rate too high
953,"I have been using pi 3b + earlier and this is my 2nd purchase of pi, this time - pi 4.  Liked it."
954,"E6 is nice..But if you are buying first time in so please buy full-kit [ Raspberry pi, Power Adapter, SD Card, And a HDMI cable ].Because Without These Basic Components Your Can't use it."
955,"Though the outer box which shipped was sealed and secured fairly well, the raspberry PI box was not. the seal was already broken and the box did look a bit man-handled. A piece of tape was holding the box together. The pi seems to be working fine and all the contents are present in the box."
956,It is a very good product. I love to work on pi. This pi4 B with 4GB i bought is indeed fast and good. Proper case to hold heat sinks and fan should be made available which can help to keep the pi4 cooler and efficient for long working hours. I am truly enjoying working on this pi4.
957,The SD card slot had problems right from the beginning. Actually I thought it was the SD card with raspbian thatbwas the problem. I could boot from another raspbian installation on another SD card. Now after 7onths the slot is dead. Tried with new eeprom. Doesn't work. Boots only from usb
958,at Amazon expensive than others
959,PRICE IS LITTLE BIT HIGHER. But thank God it is available atleast here
960,"It's really worth for the money you spending on , good product."
961,"This is a wonderful product, but buying from Amazon is a mistake.It's being sold by sellers who have their own website, and sell for cheaper there. Also, my RasPi had a faulty hardware and returning it is a nightmare.I wanted replacement, but that's not possible and 2 people have come for return and say they cannot as they are not authorised. What does that even mean?I'm getting aweful wifi speeds on this even with 5ghz network"
962,Working fine..... Excellent
963,Very good
964,Nice
965,"i need a secondary computer for some web development works1. Bought it.2. Installed rasbberry pi OS (debian)3. Installed apache,php,mysql4. installed filezila5. Runs perfectlyI recommend this to all LAMP developer. i do a lot of wordpress development on this ."
966,Genuine and functional rpi4. No issues.
967,it's good but if you are going to use it get some heatsinks for it if you want it to last longer and a protective case to avoid damaging any pins
968,Good
969,Good
970,So far all so good! 🤓
971,"Wonderful item for hobbyist and basic users. Can be easily used as a small desktop computer by adding a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse. An external HDD will be a welcome addition."
972,"Not working. red light on not blinking ,no green light. 'Signal not detected ' message in hdmi display it is within one year period."
973,Well seller is selling this from thinkbits which cost nearly 4700/- for 4GB variant.
974,"If you are seeing this product, you must already know about the raspberry pi.This is excellent single board computer.You must use heatsink for this model otherwise you it will damage."
975,Good
976,"Hdmi ports are not punctioning, useless"
977,"A good product meant for people who want basic computer operations higher to what a mobile does,without investing mo ey in a laptop/desktop"
978,The product was not working.
979,"At this price, please buy a NUC or SFF PC. Raspberry Pi is good if it costs $35 to $50. If you spend more than that, the price for performance is way too less. For this price, You can easily get a used CPU with minimum core i5 processor, gives more value for this ₹13,499.00. If you're focus is to use only the GPIO pins, I'm sure you don't need a computer with 2 to 8 GB RAM. purchase a pi 2040 or any ESP board or Arduino boards. Again, DON'T buy this at above price."
980,"Can run kali,ubuntu and other operating systems."
981,Overpriced by 2000 rupees.
982,Better process power than the previous version
983,"I hope no one buys it at this price. When the prices drop, these sellers will be left with sucking the short end of their own stick."
984,Good
985,Great little tool to learn and lab things out. Excellent learning opportunity for kids and a powerful prototyping environment for adults.The rates are way to expensive right now. wait for the shortages to end. The price should be a lot lower
986,bad product and also is costly
987,Its sowth koria made virsion not itali made product sholdering is cheep. micro HDMI ports not labled yellow. Dont know it will run or not.very diapointed already over priced ...but amazon give second class item for a primioum price tag its not expected
988,Good working
989,It’s a horrible device stopped booting within a month. Then boots sometimes and shuts down in 10 minutes. Will also destroy you SD card. Amazon claims there’s no warranty on this item though manufacturer mentions 1 year warranty.
990,The best pi yet. Lowest price on Amazon
991,"Superb product. Very good performance for the price. Gets hot quickly, so a cooling fan is necessary."
992,Nice product
993,Don't even think of buying at this price very costly.  .  .  . . . . . . . .
994,Seems Ram is fake.I could find out today only.Please initiate return.Want replacement
995,Genuine
996,Great product i got for lowest possible price during sell.
997,Good
998,Very good deal
999,Mrp is very less but I bought in 17thousend
1000,Excellent..
1001,"For installation , cable connection no detail is availableTo work on it we face lot of problem to start"
1002,(Device NOT Work)
1003,Not working
1004,I am using it as a backup device of my laptop. The noob has all the standard ability of a full fledged Ubuntu machine. Mounted in an official case with official cooling fan. Using VNC to view the output on my android mobile. You can use any webcam that is compatible with ubuntu. Superb model however price here is 1.5 times of the regular market price.
1005,
1006,Poor very poor it is very useless things don't by it it is waste of your money so dont buy
1007,Prodect is very best work operating but rs cost very high plz price lo  information sellingWork is very good frformence
1008,Brings down temperature really well. From mid 70s it's down to mid 40s. Maximum temperature I have seen on an over clocked pi is 50 degree Celsius.Fans are silent and make no noise. A bit tricky to figure out how to fit the case as it comes with no instructions but you can find videos on YouTube.
1009,This is great product for mini projects and even big projects for industry prototypes.I bought this raspberry pi 4 8gb for my final year project.
1010,"If you compare the price with official distributor price, it is on higher side and yes I am comparing after adding 18% GST"
1011,Too expansive it's available in the market for 3200 pi4 2gb and other models also less thn that 4gb 8gb
1012,"Over priced , original cost for this specs is  ₹ 4000 ."
1013,Good product
1014,Just nice
1015,This is a good product that allows to push ur pc
1016,A great product!! Managed to cool down the my Pi 4B from mid-50°s to mid-30°s!! Also very silent!! Only suggestion would be for the manufacturer to add which face is the down one
1017,Good but incompatible with official raspberrypi display. Because of the power pins being used by display.

1081,works just fine
1082,First please we want to install a softwere rather than the arduino programming software. That was available in youtube videos. After installing that softwere only the arduino programming software shows the port. So dont be worry that the arduino software showing the the port is not connected....

1096,I have use this to make a device for measure co2 concentration inside a room. Looks like it working fine.
1097,The board works fine... But is not an original Arduino BoardIt uses the atmel microprocessor but ch340g  for serial communicationGood if you want to save a buck but if you're not on a budget get the original board.

1169,"I purchased two Beaglebone Black (BBB) PCBs from Amazon---with high hopes of using same with a USB WiFI dongle---advertized as working at numerous places on the Internet---including the normally reliable folks at Adafruit.  Based on the BBB schematics this is a great design.  I liked it a lot!  However, the Linux firmware is not ready for ""prime time"" because of numerous bugs hiding in the Linux kernel, hardware drivers and utility programs.USB WiFi simply does not work.  (That is only one example of USB issues.)  Getting rid of Angstrom and switching to Ubuntu helps with WiFi performance and stability somewhat, but it is still horribly flaky, especially under high network load.  The WiFi connection drops without warning (never to come back) and/or the kernel randomly panics.  Totally useless for practical applications.At this point in time, buying a Beaglebone Black is a complete waste of money, unless maybe you want to do firmware development for BeagleBoard.Org.  That's the only way the firmware is going to get fixed because the unpaid ""open-source community"" is the only one working on this.  That business model worked for the older BeagleBoard, but it is unclear that the BeagleBone Black is going to be so lucky, especially without the same level of support from Texas Instruments for the ""new and improved"" >3.2.0 Linux kernels.Bottom line: If you want something that actually works in this price range, the Raspberry Pi is your only choice.BTW: I've been doing embedded Linux hardware and firmware development for well over a decade on many different hardware platforms.  This is NOT a ""newbie"" problem.  I've tried my best and I'm now writing off my investment of time and money in the BBB.  In fact, arguably, selling the Beaglebone Black given the current state of the firmware, without lots of warnings about same, borders on outright fraud.  BUYER BEWARE!Best regards,Bruce D. LightnerLa Jolla, CA"
1170,"The beaglebone is actually quite powerfull. I switched os to  ubuntu with lxde . I was able to surf and write programs smoothly. I even remotely connected to my desktop and use it without any problems.With a lightweight environment the beaglebone could replace a pc. That is how powerfull it is.The community is growing daily and odds are you can find someone who has done something close to what you want to do.I think the beaglebone will become ""the board""."
1171,This is a great card.  It works well and arrived much more rapidly than I expected. I've enjoyed setting it up to do an assortment of things that I wouldn't have expected it to be big enough to do.
1172,My son wanted it for his birthday and he's happy with it.He thinks he will use it to automate things at his job.
1173,Nice product.
1174,Although its little bit pricey but … its of good quality and working finely!
1175,I got a different usb cable.and one board is working good but other board is heating up when i give supply.
1176,Good product and pins were soldered as described. However the USB slot on board was deformed a bit and cable was not fitting in originally . Had to open up the usb slot with plier before using and therefore 1 star less.
1177,Works absolutely fine just install the ch340g chip driver before uploading any sketch
1178,It's a great product in this price range. You can develop your skills with this.It is compatible with any desktop or laptops. It works great. It's value for money product.I recommend this product.
1179,The product was tested and working fine. The quality of board used and solder are of good quality. Packing was such that no bending of pins takes place during transit. Programming cable supplied along with board is rugged and connectors are not of cheap quality.
1180,Very nice product but the packaging is not works its price really bad packaging

1276,Only buy this if you know well about it
1277,Nice add on to my collection!! Does better than what desktops did 8 years ago!! Can be optimised to specific applications! With further purging the unwanted applications and libraries!!
1278,"The raspberry pi worked fine when i received it.But Some GPIO pins were not functional.After 3 months, the board stopped working completely. It won’t turn on. There’s no way to use the warranty as the robocreze support doesn’t reply to emails."

1315,It's better than Arduino UNO as it has faster processing but I had power issue sometimes after using for a long time. Other than that it's a good Arduino board.Recommend it 👍
1316,Too bad... The board is not showing the port and I have checked my other boards also they are showing the port but this board is not showing the port Don't buy this product

1336,"Yesterday my egg hatched and i was ₩♡₩ this thermostat is super and mini the hatching temperature is 37:5 when bulb off , and 37:3 when bulb on press the set button for some seconds and it shows p0 and press set and set H and p1- 0:2 and p2-39 and p3-33 and p4- 0:0 p5 is 0 and p6 is OFF thats: 21/12/2019it it is good thermostat it is my 2nd incubation seems normal good for ten or more times incubation wort for money"
1337,"excellent product, solves my issue of amplifier overheating, it just switch on the fan when the desired temperature reaches. need  little instruction manual along with the product. very useful if u know how to use the product."
1338,Some times after power restart it forgot the temprater setting.
1339,Good
1340,"Temperature setting,programming is very easy. No manual provided for instructions.i have made one egg incubator with this device and worked very well. It given me very good result.it hatched 40 eggs and still working well."
1341,Very good product. I have used this in hatching eggs and its work well and I got lot of chicks.
1342,first product didn't turned on and reply ordered product only lasted 13 days . Bad experience .
1343,Bought it for making the incubator.  It was working fine but misbehaved once and the temp in the incubator reached 44 Celsius but worked fine after it.
1344,when output sort then this product damege
1345,"I used it in my incubator for hatching chicken and Quail eggs. After 2 successful hatch, it burned out and destroyed all my eggs that were about to hatch (19th day) and all chicks died inside the egg itself due to over heat as it's relay didn't cutoff the power to heat source. Myself and my whole family were left disappointed and saddened because of the malfunction of this thermostat.  My advice to buyers is that you can buy this item and use it. But, never trust it. Always have a look on it as it can cause serious damage."
1346,"Temperature reading is not accurate, vast difference not even acceptable 4-5°c difference..timer all is working fine."
1347,Controller is working fine. I saw comments on fast switch out issue from options in some similar boards. I don;t see such issue with this board. There is some time delay available before coming out of the setting options
1348,Very good product
1349,The module is working finePcb is best qualityValue of money..
1350,Product is invariably showing temperature
1351,Good product. Nice packaging.
1352,Excellent product. The only disadvantage is the product doesn't contain any manual for setting the temperature. Still then I was able to set the temperature through the buttons available on the board.
1353,gooo
1354,Best result no problem

1504,One defect sensor if all five were working it would be a steal offer but ok atleast i avoided travelling 40km for these sensors if u have a electrinic shop near by you dont even consider this product you will save time and money
1505,ultrasonic sensor not working properly
1506,"All the sensors are of poor quality except Ultrasonic sensor.For other sensors either there is range issue, or sensor does not work as expected.Not worth the money as you will be mostly be disappointed to do anything with these useless sensors."

1578,I bought digital thermostat and came to find out all three are not working. Then replaced the product and received another batch which was also not working.
1579,One of the thermostat isn't working properly.. when I return the product ..I didn't get replace these item  even after a month...I didn't get money neither a product backFully disappointed with the service
1580,"Worst product,  initially worked fine.... after 30 mins start fluctuating temperature with error of 5 degree celsius,  used for incubator,  all eggs wasted,  no return option on this product.Seems i received used or replaced products"
1581,"Problems is that, indicator value is unstable ie fluctuates unexpectedly. The point value changes by 2 or 3 in the consecutive moments. This gives inaccurate temperature measures to point 1 or 2.If any have solution please suggest"
1582,I like this product working efficiently..
1583,West of cost
1584,This is really good and value for money
1585,Very good service.... Good working products
1586,I like the product
1587,Very bad product. Don't but it. Only one is correct and both two product is damaged
1588,2 pics defects
1589,"Out of 3, 1 is already damaged when I received it"
1590,Nice product
1591,Worst product whenever we tried to fix the temperature it will stop working
1592,Ok
1593,Same item is not workingSo..good..

1603,Cut off not working
1604,Not working
1605,Very woset board pls no purchase this product
1606,2 kit are not working out of 5
1607,Not working waste of money
1608,Unstable reading. Useless
1609,I dislike this product. Because this product was disorder
1610,It's not working
1611,This is an incremental rotary encoder. You can find documentation on KY-040 online. The knob also acts as a tactile switch when pushed. The packaging is a little flimsy but the product was received in good condition. Interfacing with Arduino is simple.
1612,Exactly as described
1613,The flame sensor is just awsome. Came in a very good packaging..and works perfectly too ...it have digital output pin ans well as analog output pin.Comes equiped with a potentiometer tw no need to buy a potentiometer seperately.
1614,It's cheap and great combo dealOnly one issue was with my order that i did not received ultrasonic sensorSo they need to either improve there packing check or should seal pack the box inside
1615,"PIR needs some improvement, otherwise servo is also good but no more torque it has, ultrasonic sensor working good."
1616,"Bought 3 of these and none are as shown in the picture. As someone else pointed out, it's missing all the capacitors near the power input. It also fails to trigger when more than 1 A.C. Device is connected."
1617,Do not by this products regulator ic & capcetor not solder on bord
1618,"Don't buy this product. It came without two capacitors, a diode, voltage regulator which was suppose to be in the board as shown in the picture."
1619,The product is good measures the pH with accuracy. But beforehand the calibration should be done precisely.
1620,Low budget. Value for money
1621,Not great
1622,very difficult to use and code
1623,"It's good enough for detection, however the analogue level signal is not very reliable. The potentiometer varies the digital output threshold level, however can't be used to change sensitivity for the analogue signal, and is merely used for biasing. Also, since it's a piezoelectric microphone, you need a really loud sound in close proximity for it to detect.Distant or soft sounds aren't picked up.I bought 4 for a project, and needed analogue levels, so this was disappointing.A more sensitive condenser microphone is ideal for applications such as mine. Would have been nice if the product page had proper details."
1624,I am just using the transducer part of this since I already have the chip part. And it works as expected. It's pretty pricy though.
1625,I am using this product for overhead water tank level monitoring. Sensor is giving accurate measurements.
1626,nc
1627,It is a good device but without mounting accessory not convenient to use.
1628,Product works but not meeting my requirement of detecting small metal part

1679,Nice product
1680,"Tested the Node MCU. It works as expected. Was delivered within a day of placing the order. The packaging was terrible though. It was tossed into a large box with another large and heavy item I had purchased. It wasn't even bubble wrapped, just put into the large box in its anti static pouch. Some of the pins were bent like more than 30 degrees. I had to straighten them out by hand while hoping I don't break them in the process.At least put these kind of delicate electronics in a small box so that they do not get damaged in transit.Glad that it still functions though."
1681,"came in vaccum packaging, & moisture proof packing literally done it's job, i was frightened if it will not buy, it did. looking forward to order more stuff in future"
1682,"It's working properly, There is no problem in it..."
1683,"The ESPs are cheap. Even for the 8266s. I bought two of these and since they are so cheap, I can afford to test and destroy them. They work as intended. The only thing is the packaging. The seller sent it in an electrostatic insulated cover like all of these dev boards normally come in except that the amazon cover it came in did not have a bubble wrap or any cushion. So I am guessing something heavy sat on the package while shipping via air that a couple header pins were bent very badly in both the ESPs. One of them, I was able to bend it back into shape. The other one I had to solder out and resolder a new set of headers. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase."

1696,"Before you buy READ MY REVIEWMany has reported that their nodemcu isn't working.. but that are actually working, u have to do some steps..1) Install cp210** drivers in ur pc.(just search on google)2) Add NodeMCU in ur PC (tutorial are there in video.3) Open Arduino IDE -> Select board -> Set baud rate to 115200 -> select port.4) Enjoy!!!!!"
1697,"The same item can be bought for 350/- (approx.) , but as this is pandemic  and I can't go out, so I ordered it online. It arrived fast. it's working completely fine as mentioned in the product description. NO ISSUES with the product."
1698,its on u
1699,Realy a great day for me to receive this item .You can easily fulfill your dream project like home automation and robotics etcThnq very much
1700,"I have no doubt as to the quality, as a quality I would like to give it a five star.I ordered on the 29th, gave me the 10th. So I gave it 3 ..."
1701,Product is good. Works well but I didn't like that packing it may damage in that packing. So I'm giving 4 starts ....
1702,Yes you can use it to check if anyone jamming your hotspot or wireless network. Also you can use it for create many projects and also create capative portal. Don't missuse the product for hacking someone. Punish the evil. Be a Ethical Hacker.
1703,The product is working very well.I faced a problem that RESET and FLASH push buttons were not working.I don't know if this error was in my unit only or in all units.So please check those button before you proceed further.Thanks to Amazon for very easy returns and refunds.
1704,Easy to configure.
1705,The quality of the board is nice it work properly and also the built quality is awesome.
1706,"After receiving the product, i found it wasn't working at all and the 3.3v voltage regulator was over heating. Upon checking, i found the 3.3v and ground pin was shorted, which was obviously a manufacturing defect. Upon cleaning the solder short, the module worked flawlessly."
1707,
1708,"If it works good, the code loading is very tough,"
1709,"Working all ok, but quality could be better.."
1710,ESP8266 is cheap and work for most of what I need. It also has lower power requirements fit on the tiny breadboards.
1711,"It is a great product. Working correctly as programmed. It has poor packaging, my few pins were bent. I had to correct it through my breadboard. Overall it has value on its price. I compared it with my other nodemcu. It is the best one. We have to upload a link in arduino app for getting the esp8266 board manager."
1712,"Its the best board that you can get for your IOT projects ! Works flawlessly but you may need to know how to code and upload stuff in it before you get it. I'm 100% satisfied. I've been using for 3 months , dropped several times 😅 but still , It's a pretty nice board!"
1713,Good Product But Bad Packaging
1714,Good product for IOT based project.
1715,Device and quality is good. Its been 15 days I am usung it my DIY projects. No issues so far. Good packaging and delivery.
1716,Working as expected. Product received as per specifiçation
1717,Good at this price range.And i got LOLIN v3 board.And the chip is CH340G.
1718,
1719,I have nearly uploaded the codes 50 times and it is still working fine. Always connect to hotspot within seconds.Nice and good to use for basic IoT projects.
1720,"I used this one for hobby and don't have any perticulary issue. In case any of you guys using it first time in Arduino ide""Google how to add esp8266 library""  it will save you some time."
1721,ESP8266 a cheaper development environment for electronics beginners with WiFi Support.I/O pins are less but it's OK to have it. In my purchased product Inbuilt LED goes off when it's GPIO pin set to HIGH and illuminate when LOW.
1722,"Got the product ontime , though this nodemcu needs additional driver to install from manufactures site in order to get this functional"
1723,Nice and genuine Amica board form cloudtall India . I got some problems to program Amica esp 8266 nodemcu with phone but at the PC there is no problem 😉
1724,Good product
1725,Excellent small module for iOt projects.I used it to make a live YouTube subscriber counter using max7219 led dot matrix display.No driver issues or WiFi connectivity issues.Been using it for 2 weeks continuous and no issues.
1726,Superb
1727,Awesome. Give it a try
1728,Good product
1729,Super
1730,"Perfect for simple projects. This model of ESP8266 sensor already has a microcontroller in board, so if you're planning to use it with an Arduino board I'd recommend buying one without because it'll be cheaper."
1731,But it's good I ll use it in any other projects
1732,I ordered Amica nodemcu but I received Lolin esp8266.Product is good but the one thing is wifi range is too small.Packaging was also good.
1733,Not bad
1734,Amazing product. Working nicely without any issue.
1735,"Node MCU was good but it's two pins were slightly bent but it is not a issue, I rebent them. It is good and working fine but they should use thick foam for the pins under the nodeMCU."
1736,Got different product than what described by the seller.
1737,Well it's an good choice to buy it.
1738,Product is good but pins are not so straight or perpendicular they are just bent at 20 degrees. But can be resoldered . Anyway nice product
1739,"Its a clone but works fine, i am using it as a deauther. Awesome product you can go for it. Only one thing use good quality of usb cable then it works fine."
1740,Nice to use
1741,"Nice budget board for IoT related stuff I wish they provide more gpio in this one ,I recieved this board in ROBOTBANAO PACKAGE no vendor mentioned on the board overall board works fine..."
1742,NodeMcu ESP8266 is a very cost effective IoT device. This particular product is well built and works fine. It comes with the CP2102 USB-UART bridge.
1743,The seller has mentioned in his description a CP210x driven microcontroller but this one comes with a CH340G chip. Have had issues with CH340G in the past. Thankfully this one is just about working. Though initial test has indicated atleast one GPIO pin seems to be malfunctioning. Packaging is poor for this kind of sensitive product but that is pretty much a norm with every seller upto date.
1744,Presentation is averageValue for money: I think noAccuracy: little bit
1745,"Its an ok product, Cheaper Options available"
1746,Value for money good product working properly happy this product
1747,All thing working properly :) And packaging is awsome! I see some review's say  about bend pinsBut in my case ! I got Excellent prodect :D
1748,Works as expected. Flashed tasmota. Build quality is good. No apparent defects.
1749,Packaging is good. Looks neat. Small form factor. yet to try to work it. Will update as I go further.
1750,Good
1751,"Good quality and works well, value for money and serves many purposes."
1752,I am using it with DHT22 sensor for my AC automation.And it works great.
1753,Superb quality packaging is too Good and Working Well i tested love this Esp 12e. THANKS AMAZON
1754,its perfect working
1755,Quality product.

1770,Nice product at reasonable cost
1771,Excellent product log range
1772,I bought it for my wifi jammer mini project. It's quality and sturdiness is quite impressive. It's like a small brother of Ardino. It can be used for many engineering projects.
1773,"As per the product description (and the images) it should be an Amica CP2102 chip but the product I received is an unreliable CH340G chip. It, not an Amica brand board but instead it's unbranded. Seller: uilatech lab"
1774,"Best product, easy to configure, working fine packaging was good"
1775,It's working

1782,Good product
1783,Finally completed my project
1784,I don't know led was not working butBut it is connecting to wifi
1785,It is original Amica.the delivery is fast.it works well.good quality in this price tag. it fit comfortably in bread board.
1786,Bought it as a test bed for my hobby projects. still works like a charm
1787,
1788,"Good, but overpriced MCUs."
1789,Good quality and works well.
1790,This is very good product but the packaging is not good .
1791,Well packed and works well
1792,Excellent Product at tbis Price.
1793,Good for iot projects
1794,Good product
1795,Pins were bent and After i received i had not checked has i was busy with other things when i tried to connect after installing the driver device does not recognize by the PC.
1796,Very nice product and nice packing and it is working well
1797,"It's very useful ,original and functions excellentlyIt will be useful than Arduino because of less money and more function that is inbilt WiFi module"
1798,After uploading Code it starts heating at high temperatures.  It dowe not works
1799,Packaging is not good .but nice product.
1800,I loved it
1801,Good product
1802,as expected
1803,The NodeMCU is completely a Good Dev Board.The seller sells two different models with different drivers.The driver mentioned is CP21x but what I got was a CH34x.They serve the purpose but it is important to a few of us.Thank you
1804,Nice one
1805,It is a very important for iot base project. Its work very good with accuracy.
1806,Very high cost with compare to market price.
1807,I received a defective piece. I know about all the technical intricacies of working with a nodeMCU but this one's micro usb port was damaged and would start heating up right away like a heater when power 5V or 3.3V is supplied.Couldn't return as I already threw away the packaging and stuff before realising it was of no use.
1808,It's good and working as expected.
1809,"Good, works just fine. I created a 10 relay wireless home equipment controller with this device. Fast delivery."
1810,Fine working and working experience
1811,Very very bad . I was buy this product. Charging port are missing haven't usb connection port . I was return it amazon return policy is very well
1812,Good product working like charm soldering of pins are unprofessinol but else work fine till 4 month
1813,Working fine :) never expected at this price I'll get development board like this.
1814,Very good product for IOT project’s
1815,"Delivered very fast and value for money , the product is safe and working all fine"
1816,"Great delivery, good packaging. Working fine. Value for money. Firmware Flashable. Install drivers and good to go."
1817,Good product

1819,
1820,It is just awesome
1821,I Used it to make a wifi car it works good no coding error
1822,You can use it as wifi range extender or wifi killer nice product
1823,"Pin of microcontroller is bend from both side. Unsatisfied from this product, I request to all of people please don't buy any product from this seller. 😠🤬"
1824,Nice 👍
1825,"Got Original Amica Nodemcu, working fine"
1826,Good
1827,Works well
1828,Very Good product Quality and reasonable price
1829,Received duplicate one
1830,Dislike
1831,Loved  the product better for project cool
1832,"Costly, works as intended just feeling cheated by price offered. Was in need with no other option so bought it."
1833,"It is not working, the pins were already bent when the package arrived , no cushion is being provided for the safeguard of pins. Even I didn't get the separate bill for that product to return."
1834,Buld quality is very satisfactory. Good quality. Very happy.
1835,The product description (and even the image) says CP2102 chip but the product I received had  old slow and unreliable CH340G chip. It not an Amica brand board but instead it's lolin board. Also the pin soldering had lot of oxidation deposit.
1836,It serve the purpose i bought ..very godd
1837,Good stuff.
1838,Don't buy from this seller they send me used product the picture and real product totally different regulator of nodemcu also changed its look like very cheap quality
1839,Working perfectly no defect.
1840,"Problem with order, please return"
1841,avoid buying this.ckt board is poor quality.current and voltage rating is poor.. cannot drive enough current for powering mux properlyckt design is not compatible with other similar development boards.it is not lua amica
1842,Size bigger of bread board
1843,Robotbanao is delivering these kinds of fake and weak products the board I got have bent and damaged pins also some of the resistors are missing and not all the pins are working fine also they are not returning the product neither giving me the refund amazon is doing fraud to get more profit
1844,I have received but it is not working
1845,Working well
1846,This works very well
1847,Nice product...no issue register till now.Tested for many codes..works fine
1848,It is very small  🙂🙂🙂
1849,"I got defective piece,it's being heated as soon as I connected and my laptop is unable to detect the device"
1850,Good products
1851,"Amazon amazingly satisfied me with good, good working and safe esp8266"

1882,Product looks old and is not working.
1883,The border dilibary was quick but the pagate was in very bad condition  although the produck was good but the qifi Transreciver was not responding that quick as it must be
1884,Not a good quality
1885,
1886,Just a problem is that it gets off when it becomes hot i.e. within 5-6 minutes after starting.
1887,Tested nodemcu works well. Excellent product. Can opt the seller. Timely delivered. Happy that I have chosen this product for my home automation project.
1888,Does this one is can connected to arduino ??
1889,Fake amica. Worst packaging one pin came broke from the controller.
1890,Works fine
1891,Good
1892,Its quality is good but some heating issue
1893,Amazing quality
1894,Good
1895,Packing was bad but the product is good
1896,I tested this product and works. Comes with proper shielding cover.
1897,ultra poor print on PCB board.pin numbers on pcb are visible.hard to identify pin numbers on controller.
1898,It goes off at times. Rest ok
1899,Good product
1900,My son liked it very much
1901,Very easy to use on Arduino platform.
1902,It's a better solution to Nodemcu when you have a lot of devices to power up.
1903,It is giving ESP not responding for blynk.Tell which fearmware is installed (tell the version ) and if not tell what is installed. Just giving stupid card in the boz is not going wrok.
1904,Not working
1905,"I use in wifi , but do not connect with wifi"
1906,"The unit arrived alright and works fine. Just a note that the unit I received is not an original WeMos board as shown in the pictures. The chip is the commonly available AI Thinker ESP8266MOD. Functionally, it should be identical."
1907,"I use in wifi , but do not connect with wifi"

1909,NodeMCU V1.1 module.Packaging quality not so good missing antistatic bag.
1910,Fine and working perfectly ...... All as per specifications
1911,Good
1912,It was very nice product
1913,As usual very prompt delivery by amazon.ESP32 working as expected.
1914,Do not buy this product. I received an old board with bent pins. Doesn't even work
1915,Received product within mentioned time line with usb cable. Both are working fine out of the box.
1916,"Those of you buying this for 700-900 you are being scammed , this is only rs 380 or 400 max don't overpay and get scammed"
1917,"Ciertamente, es un producto que se ve que está hecho con mimo. Tiene los detalles de tener serigrafiados los pines a un tamaño que pueden leerse sin mucha dificultad. Y la capacidad wifi bien pero que muy bien. Un aparatito excelente para iniciarte en este mundillo de la domótica."

1919,I haven't had time to really access it.
1920,"Works like a charm, no complaints!"
1921,Ove not played with electronics in a long time. Things have progressed leaps and bounds! I'm LOVING the Arduino community and all the various libraries available for inexpensive modules! It makes designing a product so much easier than it used to be! I'm designing a pretty cool product around this thing using BLE. I've only had it a short time and already made huge progress. Very pleased!
1922,"Es estable, es lo que dicen las reseñas que es..."
1923,"For those complaining about Wifi stability - you should avoid using delay() function. That is the cause of your Wifi issues.Instead of using delay(), you can employ millis() in your sketch or a scheduler."

1925,"What's the point of buying a wifi-enabled device if it can't maintain a connection on a local network?I have two if these. One uses UDP on a local network and seems to have no issues.(EDIT: no, not even that is true. Sending UDP packets works reliably. Receiving them causes the board to HANG, randomly, requiring a reboot. I ended up replacing all of these with ESP8266 based boards.)The other tries to use TCP on the same local network. Connections form, but randomly go bad, and the only fix is to reset the board. This isn't a problem with a flaky wifi signal (the access point is a few feet away and no other devices on the net are having any problems) or bad power (meanwell 5v 3a, more than enough.) It seems to be the radio firmware, and now that I hunt around the arduino forum I see others complaining about the exact same issue. Even low volume traffic (a few dozen bytes a minute) exhibit the problem, and it happens many times a day. I'm experienced with TCP and know how it's supposed to work.

1935,"Das MKR WIFI 1010 ist von der Ausstattung und den Hardware ein gutes Teil.Hatte ich beim Uno beim installieren des COM-Ports durch Win 10 noch so meine Probleme (durch die verbundene Dockingstation scheiterte ich hierbei. Abgedockt ging es dann), scheiterte hier jeder Versuch. IDE und Treiber wurden mehrmals installiert gemäß Anleitung jedoch wurde das Gerät nicht mal als fremd im Geräte-Manager erkannt. Die LED`s leuchtetetn fröhlich. Nach stöbern in verschiedenen Foren stieß ich auf die Lösung ein anderes USB-Kabel zu verwenden. Nach dem 3. Versuch (bzw. Kabel) trällerte mein Win 10 und der COM 5-Port war installiert.Da dieses Problem wohl öfter`s vorkommt wäre ein Hinweis (auch im HP-Tutorial) sicherlich sehr nützlich. Würde wohl allen Beteiligten Zeit, Aufwand und Nerven sparen? Daher nicht die volle Punktzahl. Gehört meiner Meinung nach bemerkt."
1936,Aprendizado e desenvolvimento profissional.
1937,"En comparación con el Arduino MKR1000, el MKR1010 no solamente permite comunicación WIFI, sino también en BLE. Aunque no al mismo tiempo."
1938,"I am building a remote pool heater sensor to monitor the input and output temps of the water into a pool heater. This device is a perfect fit for this application.  The device is setup as a server monitoring incoming client http connections and sends data to that client browser.  I used the example for the device that was on the Arduino site.  In addition I have attached a .96"" OLED to monitor the temps locally and will be packaging everything in a 3D printed box with a battery.  I don't think I could have found a better device.Highly Recommend if you need an IOT controller with WiFi capability."
1939,"Parto dalla premessa dell'avere acquistato Arduino per mio figlio, assieme ad una lunga e costosa lista di componenti, linkati su Amazon dal professore di Tecnologia/ reti, conseguentemente tutti abbiamo dovuto adeguarci e, per evitare errori, noi genitori abbiamo acquistato esattamente quanto presente nei link della lista.Ora, quanto arrivato corrisponde perfettamente alla descrizione, tuttavia mio figlio dice che la connettività Wi-Fi è davvero pessima, con perdite di connessione che obbligano al reset della periferica (da approfondire però con il prof.), inoltre il firmware non risulta essere aggiornabile ed è bloccato alla versione 1.4.5. (o almeno mio figlio non è riuscito nell'impresa).Per adesso rimango su una valutazione neutrale, per quanto, visto l'aumento di prezzo di 8 euro, almeno il cavetto micro USB avrebbero potuto metterlo."
1940,Fácil de usar
1941,
1942,"Ottimo arduino, collegamento wifi e bluetooth molto facile, perfetto per sviluppare dei prototipi iot.Sarebbe comodo avere anche il cavo di alimentazione"
1943,"The greatest strength of the Arduino platform is unified support. This chip, like everything else I’ve used from Arduino, has worked perfectly out of the box and handled everything I’ve written for it using the Arduino IDE. To me, it’s worth paying extra for a chip with support versus using cheaper but unsupported chips like generic esp8266 products. Again, it’s a matter of preference. I can make everything work... eventually. My time has a price, too."
1944,Alles dabei. Crypto Chip. Damit ist eine Anbindung an AWS IoT ein Kinderspiel. Das konnte dann sogar meine 5 jährige Tochter alleine machen.Leider sind die Teile nicht so super günstig. Bei vielen IoT Things läppert sich das dann.
1945,"After spending too long getting the device to show up in the ports, I developed code to integrate the nRF24 chip, and everything worked okay, with intermittent issues getting the device to connect to the computer.  However, after breaking from the USB connection and going to battery power, the nRF24 chip no longer received data.  After several days of trying to isolate the issue, the 1010 seems to be mixing internal USB data channels with the SPI channels or something along that line.  Looking around, there isn't a lot of support for the Wifi 1010, and I couldn't even find anything related to this issue.  Many of the libraries in the library manager indicate that this device isn't supported.  Also, this device comes with quite a few less features than many other Arduinos.  They removed the EEPROM for one, though you can work around that by storing in FLASH, but existing code using EEPROM will need to be fixed.  There are not many digital pins.  Overall, my biggest issue is not being able to use SPI without the usb connected."
1946,"Lieferung pünktlich angekommen. Als Alternative zum ESP 32 gekauft da hier ein Akkuanschluss dran ist und ich eine Wetterstation baue. Funktion ohne Probleme und interessant um mal die Unterschiede im Stromverbrauch zum ESP 32 zu sehen. habe aber jetzt festgestellt, dass beide im Sleep-Modus verwendet werden können. Es ist Winter und Corona, da kann man noch rumbasteln;-)"
1947,"Seit Tagen ist damit eine selbst gebastelte Wetterstation im Einsatz.Wie zu erwarten funktioniert der Arduino perfekt und ergänzt die schon vorhandenen verschiedenen Arduinos.Neben vielen neuen Experimenten die mit dem MKR1010 möglich sind, sind auch schon vorhandene Projeke für den MKR1000 mit nur sehr kleinen Anpassungen möglich. Ebenfalls nahezu ohne Anpassung möglich sind Projekte für den Arduino Nano 33 IoT.Der einzige Nachteil ist der für Original-Arduinos doch relativ hohe Preis."
1948,Its perfect product
1949,I picked this up so that I could trigger my GoPro cameras via WiFi using a number of different sensors.  They pair flawlessly but if you're planning to use code intended for the earlier MKR 1000 boards there is a gotcha:  If your code relies on the WiFi101.h library you'll need to first update it to the later WiFiNINA.h library for it to work
1950,"Buon prodotto originale, sto realizzando un progetto IoT e la possibilità di alimentazione anche a batteria (LiPo) in tampone e il WiFi integrato sono ottime feature."
1951,Complètement dépassé par rapport aux ESP12 par exempl. Et très cher. Je l'ai découvert trop tard.
1952,Pretty simple to setup. Remember to load samd boards in ide and get a usb to micro usb data cable. Took me forever to realize I had a charge only cable. Worked fine when I changed cable.
1953,It's awesome but the onboard battery connector doesn't seem to work as expected...still trying to get it to charge and connect to my 3.7v LiPo single cell battery.
1954,"Buon prodotto comprato il primo non funzionante e poi cambiato con uno funzionante,Ottimo prodotto per l'utilizzo con Alexo o Google. Solo che al massimo puoi configurare solo 5 dispositivi in modalità free, invece se paghi 7 dollari al mesed 84 all'anno puoi arrivare a 20. una esagerazione per comandare con la voce una lampadina o altro."
1955,La cosa piu importante e che funziona ...
1956,"Si vede la qualità di un Arduino originale rispetto ad uno compatibile. Bellissimo il led RGB. Documentazione scarsa rispetto agli altri modelli poichè più recente. alcune informazioni si possono trovare cercando la sigla del determinato componente (esempio regolatore di tensione, processore ecc.) oppure vedendo le caratteristiche della MKR 1000 che è simile."
1957,"As described, arrived quickly and works very well. Connected to network easily. Using the Arduino IoT Cloud is a little tricky."
1958,Ottime per chi fa istituto tecnico funzionanti
1959,Can't go wrong with Arduino modules.  Plan to use this one in several projects.
1960,Tout a été respecté sans souci ; merci .
1961,
1962,Prodotto originale Arduino. Ha funzionato alla prima  accensione.
1963,"I used the identical code that I had use with the MKR 1000. I did change the board information in the IDE and got a port. it would not connect to my Wi-Fi. Minutes before I had connected the MKR 1000 and got an IP and opened a web page with the data sent from a temperature sensor. The MKR 1010 did not connect. I used an LCD display with the MKR 1010 and it would not write data to the screen. I did make an LED blink program work with it.Here's a quote from another person with the same issue, and there are others.""OK, so I added this code to my sketch:  // check for the presence of the shield:  if (WiFi.status() == WL_NO_SHIELD) {  Serial.println(""WiFi shield not present"");  // don't continue:  while (true);  }and when I run it, it tells me the shield isn't present. Bad board?I got the same thing."
1964,...grazie al WIFI creare progetti IoT  diventa molto facile.
1965,"Arduino WiFi, il limite è solo la fantasia.."
1966,"No lo compré para mí, pero la persona que lo tiene, está contento con él"
1967,"hanno fatto veramente un lavoro pessimo, il firmware non si puo aggiornare al 1.4.7 e ti rimane sempre il 1.4.5 che non comunica con IoT e ti prendono pure in giro dicendo che devi aggiornare con l'Iot e non funziona una soluzione inadeguata passate a Raspberry arduino non vale piu niente .PS . non ci sono istruzioni adeguate, i browser diversi da crome o firefox non sono compatibili, e quindi non aggionano il firmware, in questo modo fate perdere tempo a chi compra i vostri prodotti."
1968,Ottimo
1969,"Prodotto perfettamente funzionamento, configurazione immediata. Antenna WiFi ottima."
1970,JT connector wired wrong on board for lipo batteries
1971,"The WiFi module on this board is unreliable.The main issue, despite coding around it, is that the WiFi module will not reconnect once disconnected unless it goes thru a full power cycle. Kind of useless if your expectation is for unattended operation.Disappointed."
1972,"Hauptkaufgrund( Batteriebetrieb) nicht möglich,Board reagiert nicht, schade"
1973,Always got error that there is something wrong with the USB on this device. Everything else works on the same port.
1974,"Bought item, did not work, sent it back and was received by Amazon per UPS tracking system, but Amazon does not want to give me my money back!  Should I stop buying junk from Amazon?"
1975,Perfetto
1976,"At first I was concerned whether it would be orginal and to my relief it was (Robocraze is also mentioned on Arduino website as their seller). The Arduino works perfectly well. You should definitely buy it if you want to get started with robotics or electronics. Arduino is programmed using a language which is based upon C++, so you will aslo learn that. Good Luck!Note: I didn't got any conneting wire with it, fortunately I had a printer, whose wire I used."
1977,"Though price is too high, This one is original arduino with golden loop logo on the input diode , worth every single penny.But ,  -1 star because the cable is not included."

1980,"I have seen the product and ordered, I am fine with the product because its a genuine one. There might be a problem with the package because it did not have any USB cable and the external power source. I am new with this so, I am cautious with using external power source. Ya there are 7 ~ 12 volt source, then if you had given an option of buying one power supply for it, would had been better.

1994,Very good quality ...
1995,"Genuine board. I was skeptical whether I'll get the original one online. Working perfectly. When I enquired the cost of a genuine one in a nearby store it came to be around 1900. ALTHOUGH cheap boards, which are not manufactured under Arduino would meet our demands."
1996,Original product. Is available cheaper on another site
1997,"I don't know why? Everyone says they recieved a fake one. But the unit I recieved was a 100% original one with gold diode and all other stickers , manuels etc. So beware. The video of the Arduino Uno I bought is posted below. Take a look.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GYwhqDo6o"

2020,Love the price and quality 👍
2021,Non penso serva scrivere qualcosa su Arduino
2022,Bon produit mais il est arrivé sans cable
2023,Für Programmiereinsteiger sehr gut. Es gibt ein Haufen YouTube Videos dazu und mit der Zeit bekommt man eigene Ideen für Projekte.Der Microcontroller funktioniert wie er soll und ist robust. Hab einen fest verbaut und bestell mir bald den zweiten. Einen Stern muss ich leider abziehen weil da kein Kabel dabei war und kein Trafo. Ansonsten alles ok.
2024,"Arduino è sempre un prodotto eccellente, ben supportato e con una ricca dotazione di articoli, sw e librerie.Bella la protezione inferiore in plastica che fa da alloggiamento alla piastrina."
2025,Producto original con su caja y pequeño manual de instrucciones. Lo compré para un cursillo y de momento todo bien.
2026,"Cumple con su función, precio razonable comparado con otros lugares, entrega a tiempo, solo el embalaje presentó abolladuras, faltó protección."
2027,"It's an Arduino Uno. It's versatile and easy to do projects with. I love Arduino Unos. HOWEVER, this particular Arduino Uno does NOT come with a power cord or USB cord! Ordinarily, this would not be a problem; however, this caveat is NOT in the product description."
2028,"Es un proyecto para máquina de CNC  excelente calidad con el  soporte e información de fabricante considera la parte  técnica ,  especificaciones y entrenamiento"
2029,Excelente producto muy interesante
2030,Danke für die schnelle Lieferung.Produkt funkioniert wie erwartet.
2031,Producto es lo que esperaba... me hubiera gustado que tuviera el cable USB
2032,"Che dire Arduino è arduino, ottimo prodotto per la prototipazione, essendo la scheda originale non si riscontra alcun tipo di problema nell'utilizzo e nella configurazione."
2033,"Tengo varios clon, pero realmente el original es el único que no me ha dado errores extraños…Y con el me he hecho un C.N.C Laser…"
2034,
2035,"Der Arduino UNO Rev3 ist ein leistungsstarker Mikrocontroller, der einfach zu programmieren ist. Ich habe damit LED Stripes programmiert und es war eine gute Erfahrung. Die Dokumentation und die Community sind sehr hilfreich und das Board ist stabil und zuverlässig. Insgesamt ist es eine großartige Wahl für Anfänger und Fortgeschrittene."
2036,These boards can teach you anything you want to know about basic small electronics and code!
2037,Use it for coding with no problem
2038,"Con questo microcontrollore si possono creare decine e decine di progetti ed imparare a programmare con risultati tangibili, stare attenti perchè non ci sono inclusi cavi di alimentazione nè case, ovviamente servirano una serie di componenti come led, resistori, jumper, breadboard"
2039,Produit de très haute qualité aucun problème et livraison rapide.Je ne regrette pas du tout cet achat.
2040,"utilisé avec plusieurs composants ( bouton, capteur de distance, led etc. ) et elle fonctionne extrêmement bien, c'est bien une Arduino authentique."
2041,
2042,This is a very well made product with huge amounts of support available from many sources! I cannot even begin to describe all of the project that can be done with this controller! It’s limitations are only limited by one’s imagination and ability to learn coding. Start simple learn and work up to the more complex. I personally use Dronebot work shop for his tutorials and instruction ! Buy several and as you complete a project use it then build on another board. Or keep working with the same board until you have a keeper. Then bring out the other board and do the same process. I label my boards with what they are set up for so I can easily I’d them! Have some fun and learn lots!!!
2043,"This really is a great product, fast delivery and so easy to use."
2044,"Cuando la gente comienza en el mundo de la electrónica, los primeros pasos suelen ser vitales para determinar si le gusta o no. Esta placa es muy importante en esta fase, ya que es la primera que se suele comprar al introducirse en el mundillo.Es un modelo algo antiguo, pero su gran punto fuerte es que esta es la que se suele tomar como referencia cuando en algún tipo de manual de proyectos de electrónica se habla de arduino, de forma que tendrás millones de manuales compatibles con ella.Es de mencionar, que a diferencia de otras placas como la Raspberry Pi, el arduino UNO consta de un USB tipo B para ser alimentado, es decir, el cable que usan las impresoras, y no todo el mundo lo tiene. En este producto, no se incluye ese cable, de modo que quien no lo tenga, deberá tenerlo en cuenta.Otra opción para hacer funcionar la placa, es utilizar la clavija Jack, (aplicar entre 6 y 12 Voltios) que viene incluída en ella, con un cable compatible con dicha clavija (no incluído).En cuanto al temperatura de funcionamiento, dependiendo de la forma en que decidas hacer funcionar a Arduino, este se calentará mas o menos.En cuanto a sensores, no se incluye ningún tipo de sensor, la única actividad que se podrá hacer mientras no compres sensores será programar un pequeño led que viene incorporado al dispositivo.El embalaje es correcto, el cartón exterior viene puesto por Amazon, y la caja que contiene el Arduino es de típico cartón blando, aunque dentro incluye una almohadilla donde vienen clavados los pines de conexión del dispositivo.La relación calidad precio no me termina de gustar, y no porque la calidad sea mala, sinó porque para mí, hay placas Arduino mucho mas pequeñas que son mucho mas baratas y con mejores prestaciones en cuanto a conectividad, como un típico micro USB, o incluso Wifi, pero a esta placa la salva que es la mas referenciada en los manuales.Con todo esto y a modo de conclusión, recomiendo la compra de esta placa a aquella gente que quiera ir empezando con cosas básicas de electrónica, pero si lo que buscas es algo mas barato, te recomiendo buscar guías de compra que hay por internet, o para los que quieran algo mas completo, comprar un kit de iniciación, hay miles."
2045,"Works as advertised, Fairly easy to set up and get running.Lots of You-Tube videos to help you along with set up and projects.Need to order cable and sensor kit to go along with it.You will also need a bread board."
2046,"Ottimo prodotto, praticamente un must to have nel suo genere, ad un prezzo molto più che interessante!"
2047,Fa tutto quello che ci si aspetta da un arduino. Completo di base di supporto che lo rende sicuramente più comodo rispetto alle versioni sprovviste o non originali. Maneggevole e pratico. Spedizione puntuale
2048,Va bien
2049,These are old but reliable It works exactly as it should thank you!
2050,Tutto ok
2051,Excellent produit enfin du authentique mais impossible pour moi de faire ma button box que ce soit avec la méga ou la Uno impossible j'ai suivie plein de tuto j'ai fait tout comme il faut mais impossible de reconnaître mes cartes en USB Serial avec le CH340 donc impossible d'utiliser mes boutons dans les jeux je sais plus quoi faire
2052,"This appears to be a genuine Arduino board. Comes with a plastic base, packed in a genuine box and came with a few Arduino stickers to add to my project.  When I load a new sketch under the tools tab and get board info, it comes back with a serial number unique for this board.  I have already used it in a new project and it works very well.  Thank You!"
2053,El precio que pague esta bien he encontrado en otros sitios más cara la tarjeta
2054,Es justo lo que buscaba
2055,"Chi nel mondo dell'elettronica e della programmazione non ha mai sentito la parola Arduino? Ebbene, il progetto TUTTO ITALIANO (la storia ha dell'incredibile), nasce dall'esigenza di creare un microcontrollore alla portata di tutti, da programmare in c++, senza limite alla fantasia. È un progetto open source, ma io credo che quei 5/10 euro di differenza fra una copia cinese, siamo ben spesi. Il packaging è davvero ben curato, rispecchiando lo stile ultra moderno del sito. La scheda è alloggiata su una base trasparente e nel giro di qualche minuto è possibile già programmare qualcosa. Bisogna avere una nozione di elettronica (che quasi nessun tutorial ti spiega nel dettaglio). La programmazione sembra ostica, ma appena si entra nell'ottica del c++, programmare diventa anche divertente. Cosa si può fare con Arduino? Droni, automobiliRC, robot autonomi, stampanti3D, cnc, ma anche stazioni di analisi, domotica ecc ecc. Nella confezione è presente solo la scheda, senza alcun cavo di alimentazione, usb, impiantistica elettronica ecc ecc, ma grazie ad un led a bordo programmabile, potete sviluppare qualche progettino basilare senza dover collegare fisicamente nulla al di fuori della scheda. Consigliato ad occhi chiusi e vi si aprirà un nuovo mondo."
2056,"I can confirm Arduino is an excellent development platform. It is very helpful because it comes with a serial bus to USB that is readable from the software in the PC.The bootloader allows to load programs on the flash just with a botton click on the editor. There is a built-in LED on the board. The internet community is large and the documentation is good and keeps simple. If you are not an expert in Electronics (like me) and you want to try the principles this is ideal. It works actually for everything. The point is that you can't buy an Arduino for everything you make because Arduino is relative expensive because you pay for a development tool. If you do an industrial thing, you probably need standalone microcontrollers. And if you are a company you probably need ST Microelectronic 32 bits because they are good to mount in China. One thing, Arduino allows C++. I heard ST 32 is in C, no C++. I mean Arduino is perfect for study/development/prototyping."
2057,"I want to know why my ARDUINO UNO R3 cannot be automatically executed after the program burning is completed and the power is restored. Therefore, I bought it twice. The same problem still exists. Please help me. Thank you"
2058,can't get mine to work
2059,As described in the ad and easy to use for beginner who wants to learn coding.
2060,funciona bien
2061,Très contente de mon achat par attention il n y a pas le câble de branchement. Mais sinon la carte fonctionne bien
2062,"Worth getting the official uno I think, well built with a nice clear plastic base."
2063,Perfetto come da descrizione
2064,"Ho comprato questa scheda elettronica per realizzare il mio progetto di tesi. Devo dire che sono molto soddisfatto del prodotto. Ha un potenziale enorme, si possono realizzare tantissimi progetti interessanti prendendo in considerazioni applicazioni pratiche e complesse della realtà di tutti i giorni."
2065,L' ho utilizzato per il modellismo ferroviario.
2066,Wir bei mir mit einem Zusatzboard als Temperatursteuerung für eine Gehäuse benutzt und kann mich absolut nicht beklagen.Hatte bisher keine Probleme damit.
2067,"Todo correcto, sin embargo, la caja donde venía el Arduino estaba maltratada, no afecta mucho y supongo que es por el viaje, solo un punto a considerar."
2068,"Great device. I bought 3 of these and they are my go-to controller for some pretty sophisticated DIY projects. Do read about how not to over-drive the pins (demanding too much current from them). And, DO read about the difference in the +5v and ""Vin"" pins. There is a company that sells just the processor chip. They are reasonable (pkg 3) and I recommend having them on hand in case Murphy stops by for a visit. If you follow basic principles and NEVER try connecting a pin to something for ""trial & error"" but instead, be certain of the voltage AND current potential that you are supplying (or demanding), and this beautiful device will work like a horse. When it comes to your connection to the computer, some Windows serial ""portage"" issues arise but it's a matter of persistence. The Arduino IDE (programmer) has ways to let you see how things are going and which PORTs are connected and working. This is the only part that can be frustrating (other than writing software bugs. :-)  Enjoy.. here's what I think about it and how I use it this week:Have fun:Keep in mind that if your project is complex and you need more pins, you can use the nice I2c bus that this UNO has available and you can connect Slave devices to expand the ""pin-age"". :-)  I am going to add a AdaFruit Trinket Pro (powered from this UNO 5v bus) and let these two guys talk to each other over I2c; exchange info, and I get tons more PWMs and digital pins too. The cool thing is that the Trinket fits right on the back of this UNO's added shield. SWEET !!As usual, these are great. Notice that this is the R3 -- exactly what you want.  I've written some great control software for controlling the RF oscillator in radio transmitters and this made the project a success. I added a stacking shield (Gikfun Prototype) for the additional hardware I needed and this UNO allows the flexibility of updating my own sketches if a new feature in my RF unit is warranted."
2069,"Producto en buen estado y el Arduino es original , todo llegó muy bien"
2070,Fa il suo dovere
2071,Still exploring components capabilities.
2072,My son and play with it to learn many new and interesting things. Endless possibilities.
2073,"Der UNO wurde in einer flachen Versandtasche ohne Polster im Format A4 für Zeitschriften versendet, so dass die Verpackung des Bausteins leicht zerdrückt war. Zum Glück ist der UNO unbeschadet geblieben. Da habe ich mehr vom Händler erwartet. Das Produkt selbst ist nicht mein erster UNO. Für einfaches und schnelles Prototyping von kleinen Projekten immer noch eine sehr gute Wahl."
2074,"Prodotto ottimo, La scatola continente la scheda, un basamento trasparente per la scheda stessa,Dei simpatici adesivi Arduino…Ma nessun cavo per collegarla al pc, unico neo."
2075,prettige plastic aan de achterkant voor het vastschoeven op het project
2076,"muchos dicen que no es original por el color, pero eso no tiene nada que ver, lo use para proyectos de la preparatoria y funciona muy bien, un amigo compro uno generico y tenía que instalar drivers para usarlo, pero con este nomas es conectarlo y empezar a trabajar con el, excelente"
2077,Muy buena calidad y precio
2078,EXCELENTE PARA PROGRAMAR Y FACIL DE USAR!
2079,E' un Arduino UNO originale ( non una copia) . Ha funzionato (e funziona tutt'ora) perfettamente.Certo è un po' caro ( si fanno pagare l'originalità) : io lo consiglio se non volete tentare con copie  di varia provenienza ( che talvolta possono dare problemi)
2080,"He tenido 3 o 4 marcas, y como la original ninguna, la calidad de señal, estabilidad en el voltaje, errores, etc. es la mejor."
2081,"Delivery was great...like one day after I placed the order. The order was for an Arduino, a sensor kit, and a camera. Everything was there, but the Arduino package had been opened...the tape at the top was torn off and the box was coming apart. I had the feeling it was something someone else returned. I'll test it in a couple days and return it if anything seems to be not working."
2082,Il prodotto è valido anche se ho dovuto restituirlo.
2083,Ottimo prodotto. Affidabile e ben funzionante. Consigliato
2084,スプラ３のイラストを手書きより、自動ドット打ちをしたくて、購入。ubuntuで簡単に出来ました。手のひらサイズなので、画像を記録しておいて友達のSwitchに繋いであげてもいいかな～って思ってます。
2085,Fast einer eierlegende Wollmichs..Arduino halt
2086,"Versatili sono ed arrivato anche puntuale, l’unico limite è l’immaginazione"
2087,Thanks
2088,"I was nervous to give arduino a go, as no matter how much I read about the programming I wasn’t getting my head around it. I gave in and bought the board as I needed to have a go to progress with my project idea. The free software is really intuitive, and the built in library’s show you what you need to do so you can borrow bits of code from there"
2089,Item was of the most excellent quality! Delivery was notably fast. The packaging was immensely beauteous.
2090,La placa arduino uno es original viene con una base de platico y unos Stickers que son un pequeño extra. No trae el cable. 100% recomendable
2091,"I'm a newbie to the world of Arduino, so I am very limited in what I can do with the Uno.  I recently made my wife a plant self-watering system.  It was fun and practical.  I would highly recommend the true Arduino board (there are Chinese knockoffs) as they are better built and have the nice plastic tray it sits in so the solder points on the underside are disturbed.  That's important to keep it from getting damaged.If you're new to Arduino, I'd recommend watching lots of YouTube videos about how it works. The actual device does not come with any explanations for either how the two power ports work or any of the analog or digital inputs.Doing simple projects are a great way to start in the world of micro electronic projects.Enjoy!"
2092,"I purchased this genuine Arduino Uno R3.  What more can I write?  You know this board is going to work well with the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software because this board is from the originators of Arduino.  The latest versions of the R3 dropped  the little map of Italy from the silk screen artwork on the board, but there is a hologram on the box that would probably be difficult to counterfeit.  The genuine Arduino costs a little more, but you know it is going to work and you won’t be wasting time trouble shooting your project due to a junky clone board instead a fault in your code.  Some of your purchase price is also going to support future Arduino development instead of just landing in someone’s pocket.The attached photos show what you’ll receive in the box and a close-up of the authenticity hologram."
2093,i recommend it
2094,Il pacco originale all’interno del pacco Amazon era aperto senza sigillo. Mi riservo di provarlo e nel caso non funzioni fare il reso
2095,"Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Arduino, zudem kostet er fast gar nichts, kann aber damit fast alles ermöglichen. Ich selbst habe damit eine günstige CNC Steuerung gebaut und bin sehr zufrieden. Zudem gibt es auch noch eine große Komunity und zahlreiche Anleitungen und Videos zu Projekten."
2096,Acabados perfectos y funcionalidad y versatilidad muy buenas como siempre
2097,Producto original.
2098,"Hatte bisher wegen dem höheren Preis nur Klone des UNO3 benutzt. Da es das Orginal nun als Sonderangebot gab, habe ich ihn mir gekauft. Funktional ist  kein Unterschied, aber im Detail merkt man schon, das dies das Orginal ist. So haben zb. die PIN Buchsen einen Aufdruck im Kunststoff, nicht nur auf dem PCB. Werde es wieder so machen, solange es nicht >10% teuerer als die China Versionen ist."
2099,I've been using Picaxe for years and enjoy the flexibility of them. Just didn't enjoy Arduino like I hoped I might.
2100,"This item came to me on the next day (with prime) with slight squashing of the small box due to the delivery packaging used however the contents of a sheet of arduino/DIY themed stickers, a ""thank you"" note from arduino and an arduino uno board (and if anyone is wondering, this is the official board) were completely unharmed. The box, with a bit of adjustment was soon restored and it's now the storage for my uno board with a cereal box like top.The board itself is fully functional with the bootloader flashed onto it already.I previously purchased an unofficial arduino compatible nano board from another seller on Amazon which fully worked and came with a USB cable (which official boards don't) however I find that it takes up too much breadboard space which would be better used for components and modules to be attached to the arduino.For those considering purchasing a cheaper, unofficial, arduino compatible board: go ahead, but a cheap board for less, in the knowledge that the more sales of these boards there are, the less money Arduino get from your purchase to go towards designing more advanced boards in the future. I strongly believe that official boards are better (if more expensive) as they have clearly printed pin numbering on the PCB and the headers themselves, they physically feel more sturdy and less tatty, and over all they look a whole lot better that the cheaper alternativesArduino boards are useful and educational, they have helped me to learn to code better in the past, and I hope they do so in the future"
2101,Arduino è qualcosa di eccezionale. Bisogna però saperlo usare
2102,"Bonjour,J'avais besoin d'une plaque mère pour un projet personnel, vu que je suis débutant, après plusieurs recherches je me suis décidé par Arduino Uno par sa simplicité et polyvalence.Comme aspects positives:- Le produit corresponde bien à la description- facile à utiliser- Le logiciel pour le programmé est gratuite et disponible sur le site web du fournisseur- Rapport qualité- Prix acceptableAspect négatifs:- le plus grand est l'absence du câble pour le connecter à le pc, j'étais vraiment très déçu quand je me suis rendu compte qu'il étais pas inclus dans la boite. Cela ma fait perdre 3 jours de plus pour atteindre à recevoir un acheté sur Amazon.- On se rendre compte très rapidement que la disponibilité des ports dans la plaque est assez limité, la plaque n'est pas adapté pour des projet ayant besoin de connecter plusieurs modules au même temps.👍J'espère que mon avis vous a étais utile 👍"
2103,"Leider war die Platine von Anfang an defekt, habe extra das Orginal gekauft um so etwas zu vermeiden.Direkt eine neue Funktionsfähige Platine zugeschickt bekommen."
2104,"Honnêtement j'arrête les copies car elle sont vraiment pas top, j'ai 2 méga qui sont de chez elegoo c'est une honte, impossible de les mettre en mode dfu et pire impossible de flash le 16u2 pour mette le mode dfu, franchement acheté les officiels c'est un peut plus chère mais ça fonctionne comme sur le papier et la qualité est au rendez-vous."
2105,Tot be
2106,"Come neofita è presto per dare una valutazione. Si tratta comunque di un prodotto originale, perfettamente curato sotto ogni aspetto, dotato del semiguscio trasparente per proteggere i contatti inferiori durante l'uso.I primi test sono stati più che mai facili, il programma è stimolante e capisco perché abbia avuto tanto sucesso.La scheda sarà anche un po'  più costosa di una dei tanti cloni che si trovano sui mercati orientali, ma credo sia meglio iniziare l'avventura partendo da questo punto di riferimento, Arduino 1 Rev. 3 made in Italy.Questo perlomeno nel caso in cui si cerchi di fare un progetto affidabile nel tempo.Tanto per citare un esempio, da molti anni in elettronica (nel campo  delle radiocomunicazioni) vengono commerciate apparecchiature nuove identiche con marchi differenti e dai costi inferiori nelle quali però le tolleranze e la selezione dei componenti interni fanno emergere i limiti di utilizzo anche solo a seconda delle condizioni di temperatura... e quindi a ragion veduta, non sempre ne vale la pena."
2107,No viene con cable por eso no le doy las 5 estrellas
2108,I supported arduino in my first ever attempt to use microcontrollers. I bought this Original Arduino WiFi UNO R3 and a starter kit. Mine came in a Arduino Box with Arduino paperwork inside.Much of my initial work and concept would not have been possible had I not found their site about connecting two arduino over tcp client server. So it’s only fair that I return the support.  Please make sure you install the correct Arduino library to get your project to work. I had no issues with the board so far.You will need to go to Arduino for the instructions and example sketches (programs)  to learn how to use it.
2109,Une interface programmable aux multiples usages.
2110,Cadeau
2111,"Initially, it wouldn't work on my laptop. After hours of trying I finally found the trick which may help any newbies like me. Check the COM on the Arduino then look in the device manager Ports, if the COM is the same as the item then it should work. If the COM is different then Right Click on the item in PORTS and right click Properties. In Properties open Ports settings then Advanced and change the Port to the COM on the Arduino. After that is should work properly as mine is doing now."
2112,I decided to pay a bit more for a genuino and I am glad I did.  Mine came boxed nicely with a document plus a plastic mounting base.  While I will continue to buy the less expensive clones for day to day work I am glad that I went with this option.
2113,Ottimo prodotto per chi sta iniziando ad affacciarsi al mondo dell'elettronica.
2114,"I would give it 5 stars, but the box mine came in had clearly been tampered with. The board was fine and nothing was missing, but I would expect better from Amazon.This board is a fantastic choice for beginners, as it includes lots of pins and most beginner tutorials use it. There are also some full kits available that include the board along with a collection of electronic components (resistors, capacitors, cables, sensors, segment displays, and so on), and most of them include a project book and everything you need besides a PC, so that's another choice for the beginner (I would imagine children would enjoy playing and learning with that). On top of that, there are a bunch of expansion boards available designed for the Arduino Uno, so you might want to look into that.Please be aware that there are smaller and larger Arduino boards available. This is a good starter board, but I have been using Arduino Nanos (about four quid on Ebay) that are just as easy to use, but smaller and far cheaper, meaning that I can break them without too much worry. I would avoid the Digispark boards - they are kinda dodgy in my experience, require special software, and apparently they can break easily."
2115,What I expected but wished it was not so pricey.
2116,"I love Arduino boards. The design impresses me how I can power it in different ways, easily plug it in, program, then I'm ready to go etc. This is the third Arduino Uno that I've bought (I've also got an equally impressive Arduino Due although that's at 3.3 volts) but I put this particular board in to question. It is a different colour and has helpful writing on the sockets (a good thing). I wondered if it's a fake copy so I looked on arduino.cc and they have changed the design to a teal colour. No problem. It also has a plastic protector. I have also received stickers with it like with the other boards so it seemed genuine.I plug this in to the laptop and the software downloaded from arduino.cc said that this is an uncertified board. This worried me a little (again). It still works, I can still program it as normal. The board checks out electrically.What the problem is/was, is that the company split in to two: arduino.cc and arduino.org but as of the end of 2016, they have merged so this issue shouldn't be an issue anymore. Just use the board as normal, download the latest software and don't worry about it. Make sure any additional libraries you've downloaded (e.g. RadioHead) are copied in to the libraries folder."
2117,"Pro: It is a genuine Arduino, it is manufactured with higher quality than the knockoffs.I really liked the acrylic case it came with. which surprised me.I like the removable AT mega chip. I frequently build projects without the Arduino boards, so the Uno becomes a chip programmer.Con: More expensive than the knockoff. but it is nice to support the program that provides all the free software.Note: I bought this also to deal with software issues, I use a lot of knockoffs and you really need an original board to help troubleshoot software issues."
2118,I use this in conjunction with a laptop to keep track of the number of laps and time per lap for my slot car track. Works great.
2119,Arduino originalFonctionne parfaitement
2120,Alright for uni
2121,This is the second one I purchased.  The first one did not have either boot loader so I needed to buy the second one to program the first.  Both are working now but was disappointed with the first one.
2122,"Neben der problemlosen Inbetriebnahme punktet der Original Ardunio UNO mit vernüftiger Qualität. D.h. die Bauteile, insbesondere die Steckerreihen sind gerade aufgelötet (im Gegensatz zu den Klonen), die Lötstellen sind vorbildlich, insgesamt eine ordentliches Produkt bei dem auch die CE Kennzeichung echt ist. Bei meinem Arduino war bereits der Blink-Sketch aufgespielt, d.h. das Teil wurde vorher in Funktion getestet."
2123,"Comprato tanti anni fa ormai, molto utile per divertirsi e fare progetti, anche scolastici."
2124,I used this product to set up a temperature and humidity sensor. It’s very easy to setup using the guide that can be found in the Arduino website. There is nothing not to like in this product! Will definitely order again and try it out for color sensor project.
2125,Item was of glorious quality. Charming packaging. Delivery was ever so quick. Service was wonderful.
2126,"I received this Arduino Uno from MDN® USA.  This Arduino Uno is authentic.  It is the new design (teal color).  All silk screening is spot on and has quality components.  The difference from traditional authentic Arduino Uno (which I have and is green/blue color mixture from Arduino.cc) is silk screening on header pins for easy identification when using shields, which is high quality screening.  The header pin silk screening is value added in my opinion (see last sentence to know more).  In addition, the Arduino Uno comes with a clear plastic base (quality) for the board to rest on surfaces without accidentally grounding/shorting pins on bottom of board.  The clear plastic base has two screw holes for securely mounting to surface.  The Arduino Uno board clicks into clear plastic base and is easy to remove without releasing unintentionally (i.e. positive hold).  This Arduino Uno is derived from Arduino.org instead of Arduino.cc, which is splitting hairs and not going to elaborate."
2127,"The fakes are getting good!!The packaging appeared to have been re-used from a genuine product. The fake ""Uno"" is a slightly smaller size, so it doesn't stay in place in the included plastic tray. When I compare side-by-side to a genuine Arduino Uno from a starter kit, as well as a genuine Arduino Mega, I can see the quality of the printed circuits on the fake board is similar, but slightly lower than, the genuine Arduinos. Also, the markings along the USB/power port edge of the underside of the board are different (see side-by-side photo; genuine board on left). The markings on the genuine Uno match those on the Mega, as well as seen in the images on Arduino's Web site.The print quality and ink used for the printed text/logos on the board also are more noticeably different when compared side-by-side. The fake has shinier ink which appears raised from the board a little, whereas the genuine Arduino's printed text looks more matte and flush the board. The quality of the soldering is also slightly different between the two. Finally, the genuine Uno board has a small number (6, in my case) next to the soldering on the underside of the USB port, which is missing on the fake."
2128,"Exactly what I needed for my project.. Excellent value and very easy to use.. There’s so much you can do with these arduinos!! Everything from motor controllers to light shows to information displays, arduinos are super easy to set up and use!! There’s already a ton of information and programs out there, and learning to program them yourself isn’t that difficult.."
2129,"Like Arduino, easy to program can use Raspberry Pi 0 2 W as a host"
2130,Not that much more expensive than the nearest copy and works extremely well. Bonus that it's made in Italy. Plane to buy several more.
2131,Ok
2132,"Habe diesen Mikrocontroller bestellt und zwei Tage später schon damit experimentiert. Es macht richtig Freude, damit umzugehen. Das Installieren unter Windows 7 beispielsweise läuft zunächst in einer Windows-eigenen Routine, die jedoch fehlschägt. Das ist normal; zudem wird auf der Arduino Website darauf hingewiesen. Nach der manuellen Treiberinstallation per Systemsteuerung läuft alles tadellos. Die USB-Verbindung habe ich über einen HUB geschaltet; dies ist sehr empfehlenswert. Damit ist das Motherboard des angeschlossenen Computers geschützt.Der Arduino macht, was ihm einprogrammiert wird. Zuerst bastelte ich mittels extern besorgter Bauteile das Blinklicht, wessen Programm bereits im Speicher war. Ich schließe das darauf zurück, dass mit diesem Testprogramm seitens des Herstellers geprüft werden soll, ob der Controller funktioniert. Daher ist es bereits im einprogrammiert.Mein dritter Sketch war bereits ein Lauflicht mit 6 LED's. Ich habe den Arduino gekauft, um damit hauptsächlich das Programmieren zu erlernen. Natürlich gebe ich zu, dass es mich reizt, diverse Schaltungen auszuprobieren - und noch viel reizvoller wird das Kreieren eigener Projekte.Fazit: Wer einen Controller sucht, der leicht in der Handhabung ist und dessen Programmierung mit einer gewissen Einarbeitungszeit verständlich ist, wird mit dem Arduino gut beraten sein.Vor allem für Neueinsteiger ist die Open-Source-Plattform mit den Bespiel-Sketches überschaubar und unkompliziert. Was ich für sehr wichtig erachte: Sollte mal was schief gelaufen sein, so lässt sich der Prozessor mühelos austauschen, weil er sich bei diesem Modell in einer Steckfassung befindet."
2133,Tutto come promesso nell annuncio di vendita
2134,I purchased a CNC kit with a generic Arduino. Had constant USB communications issues. I read something about the COM chips that were used in the generic board being different so for less than $25.00 I figured I'd give it a try. My machine works perfectly now. Worth every penny!
2135,What's not to like?
2136,"Wenn man sich mit der Programmierspache auskennt, macht es richtig Spaß."
2137,La scheda risulta come da descrizione!La ricomprerei
2138,"The Arduino arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion.  Once you download and set up the IDE, experimenting and use is quite fun.  I haven't had any issues with it, just remember to follow ESD precautions, don't short it out and make sure you use a good regulated power supply."
2139,"Figured it was about time I sprang for the ""real"" thing.  Zero complaints about the Metro 328 (or the mfgr-good clone...) good quality and docs."
2140,"The Arduino is easy to use with Visual Studio.  Most of the videos from the community are absolutely terrible, but this Arduino is controlling 2 motors of a 200 lb remote control vehicle using PWM for speed control.  I connected a ESP8266 and send UDP packets with the motor position from my PC, and the Arduino uses the data in the packets to set the PWM.  There's a noticeable delay in the system so far, but so far the Arduino is working great."
2141,"I purchased this board because one that I got in a kit, from another vendor, didn't seem to be working. The board I got appeared to be a cheaper knockoff. So I got an Arduino Uno instead of a 3rd party board. The Arduino Uno worked perfectly right out of the box."
2142,Liked the simplicity of setting up and running! Makes electronics hobby more enjoyable and makes learning fun!
2143,"El producto es el mismo que se ve en las imágenes publicadas, tiene varias funciones, puedes utilizarlo para experimentos o prácticas básicas de electrónica."
2144,This is my first Arduino. So far so good. Price was good (on sale for about $20) The info I received with it mentions that it was tested three times. That made me feel confident it would work and I wouldn’t have to troubleshoot a bed product. Now I want one with BLE and WiFi.
2145,I have no complaints. Works well with Mobiflight and FS2020
2146,The UNO is perfectly work. But I still have problem to setting up the nano s. I don't know why. I tried with installing the drivers. But still the same. It would be really appreciated if you can advice me how to do it
2147,"Er zijn veel klonen te koop, maar het origineel is toch veel mooier en de pin nummers zijn ook op de zijkant afgedrukt van de connectors zodat je makkelijker een verbinding maakt, terwijl dat bij klonen niet het geval is. Je ondersteund met het kopen van een iets duurdere module de ontwikkeling van nieuwe originele arduinos."
2148,
2149,Die Funktion und die Handhabung sind leicht.
2150,"Arduino Uno è fenomenale!Sia per progetti che laboratori IoT, che anche solo per divertimento.L'ambiente software IDE è estremamente intuitivo e pieno di esempi e tutorial, inoltre in rete si trovano miriadi di esempi per iniziare a programmare gli sketch (in linguaggio semplificato C/C++).Almeno il primo compratelo originale! Visto il costo veramente basso vale la pena acquistare l'originale open source Arduino anziché i cloni.. promuoviamo questa eccellenza italiana!!!"
2151,My Aarduino Uno arrived fine and it seems undamaged but the plastic case they included makes no sense....one half fits the board the other half doesn't.  A waste of money that will make you have to buy another case.
2152,Well done
2153,Perfetto.
2154,"Thanks , Excellent store , save box and recommendation store"
2155,Arduino è Arduino
2156,"I like this ARDUINO, it is made very accurate"
2157,This is an excellent Arduino Uno REV3. I bought seven of them for my robot projects. I inspected each one carefully. They are all in perfect condition. The low price is irresistible. I very happy with my purchase.
2158,使いやすくて、ネット上での情報も多く気に入ってます。
2159,Ordered for undergraduate research projects. This is as good as we expected and is a good deal
2160,"I would typically recommend that most people make use of a nano for most simple projects, but the uno has a lot of usability features like larger spacing and dedicated power if you aren't using USB. But keep in mind you can get smaller and cheaper hardware that effectively does the same thing if you purchase a nano or nano clone."
2161,Schnelle Lieferung. gerne wieder.
2162,It is incredible but i'm a little bit disapointed because the package was ruined
2163,Nulla da dire  ottima in tutto.
2164,Ist sehr gut für Anfänger
2165,"Habe mir den Arduino Uno gekauft, da ich vorher ein raspberry pi verwendet habe, aber dann schnell merkte dass ein Arduino besser geeignet war für mein Verwendungszweck. Arduino kam schnell an, sogar früher als angegeben. Verpackung war okey, war in einem Umschlag und dadurch wurde leider der Arduino etwas eingedrückt, allerdings ist alles heil geblieben. Arduino angeschlossen sketch hochgeladen, alles super soweit. Habe Einige Tests gemacht und wollte ihn dann wieder an den mac anschließen um den Sketch zu verbessern und siehe da: Er wird nicht mehr erkannt! Ich habe keine Ahnung woran es liegt. Manchmal klappt es. Manchmal muss ich die Arduino IDE Neustarten. Manchmal sogar mein ganzen mac. Und manchmal wird er dann immernoch nicht erkannt. Vielleicht ist mein Model fehlerhaft? Ich weiß es nicht. Von original Ware für den Preis hätte ich echt mehr erwartet... schade. Vielleicht liegt’s am Kabel oder am Mac, aber das denke ich eher nicht. Ansonsten funktioniert er wie er soll, wenn er sich denn mal verbindet.Ich weiß nicht ob ich ein fehlerhaften Arduino erwischt habe, deswegen empfehle ich ihn weiter."
2166,I am so excited over all the different possibilities that can be created using this circuit board. The item arrived earlier than scheduled which was a major plus. Everything up to this point as been A+. Thank you so much!
2167,My toner was hardly used but was a few years old. This saved me $300 to $400 in toner cost. I almost threw the printer out because cost less to buy a new one than to purchase toner lol
2168,Arrivato nei tempi previsti. ottimo prodotto attinente alla descrizione. sono molto soddisfatta.
2169,"Attenzione ai particolari, contenuto in una base di plastica trasparente che evita falsi contatti nella parte inferiore della basetta"
2170,si.
2171,
2172,"I'm working with this Arduino last several days, it does what I needed.The package came with broken bottom plastic case, which I glued myself. This was the only minor issue.Another thing that buyers must know - the board comes without cable. You can buy the board, have it in hands, but cannot use because there is no cable. I don't have any argument on this, because that was my mistake, I had to read the items list carefully.I'd recommend this Arduino Uno."
2173,"Der UNO den ich bekommen haben ist ein Original mit Siegel und italienischem Aufdruck.Hat auch alles sofort funktioniert, ein USB-Kabel ist nicht dabei, aber auch nicht schwer zu bekommen, ich hatte noch einige davon herumliegen. Also an den Rechner angesteckt und läuft.Die Programmierung erfolgt in einer eigenen Sprache, die extra für den Arduino angepasst wurde. Wenn man eine C-basierte Sprache beherrscht kann man gleich drauflos schreiben, die Dokumentation auf arduino.cc ist gut strukturiert und verständlich.Grundlagenkenntnisse in der Elektronik sind hilfreich, wobei man auch jede Menge Anleitungen findet.Ein paar Bauteile zum Anschließen sind auch nötig, da das Board sonst nur mit der aufgelöteten LED blinken und ein wenig serielle Kommunikation kann. Vorsicht mit den zulässigen Spannungen und Stromstärken der einzelnen Ausgänge!Ich habe schon einige Schaltungen realisiert, mit Spannungsteilern, Transistoren, Ultraschallsensoren und LEDs experimentiert, Servos angesteuert, Motorbrücken gelötet, und werde nun ein kleines Fahrzeug bauen. Für den Preis bekommt man ein extrem vielseitiges und leistungsfähiges Modul, kann ich Technik-Interessenten nur empfehlen."
2174,"You have to respect how cool these controllers are. You can do so much with this, and learn so many things- it’s fantastic. A great deal- if you are on the fence, hop off. Buy it. Begin the journey!"
2175,"Exactamente la que mi hijo necesitaba para el Instituto, es la genuina, nada de copias. El envío rápido y perfecto."
2176,Ottimo prodotto di qualità
2177,"I purchased this Arduino UNO R3 several months ago from Amazon. It is an Italian made board with all the right parts and all of the solder joints are good. I understand that cheaper boards may use different chips and have pore solder joints. You get what you pay for. Also not mentioned in the listing I received a clear plastic bottom cover with my board. Nice to have. This board is the real thing and works beautifully.  If you are learning a new subject it is always a good idea to have the right tools, materials, and books before you begin."
2178,Teniá otras 2 placas Arduino UNO R3 clones y decidí adquirir la ORIGINAL para colaborar con el desarrollo del software libre.Funciona correctamente y si no quereis tener problemas de funcionamiento y de drivers la recomiendo
2179,Great product and a lot of fun. Takes some research and practice to learn how to use it. Be patient.
2180,"For some reason the first one I got quit being recognized by my computer. The light would turn on with USB, but it didn't show up in devices. After hours of resetting and troubleshooting, I returned it. The new one works fine."
2181,"If you want /and or / need an Arduino, buy the genuine article.  Quality is far better than any of the Chinese clones.  Headers are straight, solder joints are textbook perfect and power regulation is cleaner than the clones.  Nice even +5Vdc within 0.01 volt.  Buy the Arduino - Genuino.  It is well worth the extra couple of dollars."
2182,"Ideal, um damit anzufangen, erste Programme zu schreiben und einfach mal zu experimentieren. Keine Probleme mit Schnittstellen, die man manchmal mit preiswerten Clonen hat. Außerdem sind die Kontaktsteckdosen schon angelötet. Man kann also direkt damit loslegen.Die Arduino Plattform mit dem kleinem Entwicklungssystem bietet unglaublich viel als Open Source Plattform. Tolle Sache für Anfänger, Amateure und auch für Profis."
2183,If small electronics are your things. My have programmed C and C++ and was surprised at how easy it was to get up and running with this and making it do things from simple LED patterns to controlling servo motors. The kids also enjoyed messing with it as well and started fiddling with the code and making it do new things.
2184,"This microprocessor has extensive documentation, YouTube videos, etc on its use.  It will interface with a huge variety of sensors.  It's a fun way to learn more about electronics and ""C"" programming."
2185,"Mit einem Original Arduino Uno kann man eigentlich nichts falsch machen - es ist ein perfekter und unkomplizierter Einstieg in die Entwicklung oder das Basteln mit Mikrocontrollern, da es unzählige Beispiele mit diesem Board im Internet zu finden gibt.Ich habe ihn gekauft, um mit alten Diskettenlaufwerken Musik abzuspielen. Mit der (kostenlos bei Heise als PDF abrufbaren) Anleitung aus der Make zum Thema ""Floppotron"" war das sehr schnell erledigt. Man benötigt dazu nur noch einige Diskettenlaufwerke (4-8 empfehlenswert), eine Stromversorgung (ein Altes PC-Netzteil ist optimal) und ein paar Jumper-Kabel (z.B. "
2186,"Esta tarjeta la adquirí para iniciar en el mundo de ARDUINO y su software. Es una herramienta muy recomendable para personas que inician en el campo del diseño de proyectos con pocos conocimientos de la electrónica. Yo realizo proyectos con microcontroladores, FPGAs, DSP pero con este tipo de tarjetas optimizar tiempos. desde luego tienes recursos limitados pero vale la pena para aprender."
2187,Real Arduino.  Worked with their web editor flawlessly.
2188,"As promised, the Arduino is a simple to set up multifunctional board that can be up and running in a matter of minutes after watching short tutorials on YouTube. No college degree necessary."
2189,Arduino UNO R3 funktioniert auf Anhieb.
2190,The fine quality of the product was very apparent. The addition of the plastic case made much easier and safer to work with.
2191,"Che dire,Per chi come me è appassionato di informatica ed elettronica allo stesso livello ARDUINO UNO fa al caso vostro.Come sempre con Amazon Prime il pacco è arrivato dopo un giorno con una perfetta impacchettatura: Robusta e ben chiusa.Arduino Uno arriverà senza nessun accessorio. Consiglio quindi di acquistare questa versione solo in caso di guasto al proprio Arduino oppure per averne uno di riserva, dato che da solo non può funzionare.Arduino viene collegato al PC attraverso il cavo utilizzato dalle stampanti che molti hanno in casa. Basterà collegare, Installare i driver dal sito ufficiale e grazie all'IDE di Arduino sarà facilissimo iniziare a programmare il microcontrollare ATMEGA328P.Arduino Uno originale rimane il migliore sul mercato e vi consiglio vivamente di non comprare nessuna imitazione dato che questo costa solamente 20 euro e vi assicuro che li vale tutti."
2192,I did receive the original Arduino as expected. I was actually hoping to get the Arduino book or at least a CD with the Arduino seeing that it is the original. If I knew that I would only get the board I might have opted for a cheaper alternative.
2193,"Ein toller Microcontroller, mit dem man einiges anstellen kann.Auch beim ausprobieren habe ich bis jetzt noch nichts an dem Gerät kaputt bekommen.Ist bei mir mal mehr, mal weniger im Betrieb. Immer abhängig vom Wetter und was sonst noch so zu tun ist.Mit Google eine gute Kombination um in das Programmieren einzusteigen, wenn es einem auf reiner Softwareebene zu einseitig ist!Nur schade das man nicht per Prime bestellen konnte!"
2194,"For my project:  I  used it to make a speedometer for a classic car; could work for a bicycle speedometer as well!Can control, communicate with many & most hobby & R/C motors etc...Excellent Product!"
2195,Es justo lo que ofrece y tiene una excelente performance.
2196,Good products. It is nice to support the company that kicked off the company that started the hobby but they should recognize that there are huge number of knock offs and should lower their price. It took me a long time to figure out that my USB cable was preventing me from linking up to the software. It is picky for USB cables.
2197,Se ve y se siente de muy buena calidad ya que es la original.
2198,"I mean, this is arduino. It is great, so many things you can do, so much money to throw away! I love it! Just buy some extra stuff, download some code and start playing! I already made two projects and I am not gonna stop! Buy it, buy a couple!"
2199,I can't go wrong with this arduino. It's really legit and easy to setup and for my project. Can't wait to purchase more.
2200,"Working on using it with a rigexpert aa-30.zero as an antenna analyzer, it's doing exactly what I want it to!"
2201,"This is my first experience after studying this stuff over 10 years ago.Based on my humble experience, I really appreciate the product and I think it's definitely worth the price.Therefore, I am a loyal customer starting from this week."
2202,"Ich habe mir diese Originalplatine eines Arduino Uno geleistet, um einfach mal die Qualität mit den diversen No Name Produkten zu vergleichen. Diese sind inzwischen aber so gut, dass man sie für die meisten Anwendungen problemlos einsetzen kann."
2203,"This is a great computer that's fun to use. I'm brand new to programming electronics (though I have some experience with programming), but the Arduino platform has been very easy and fun to navigate. I've had no problems with the computer itself. Great, reliable computer for an electronics hobby."
2204,"I needed another Uno and these came fast and as described. The Ardunio Uno is a must have for all kinds of projects, learning to code, and so much more."
2205,Never used one before. Had a bit of a learning curve but plenty of info on the web to help sort it all out. Very pleased.
2206,"What can I say, an Arduino is an Arduino.  Although this is pretty expensive for a microcontroller, I recommend buying the legit one to support the Arduino foundation.  So we can get more amazing stuff like this.The Uno is a great little device that's pretty easy to get up and running quick.  Even for an absolute beginner.  The vast amount of documentation and tutorials for this will help you get from a beginner to a pro nice and quick.It arrived unbroken and nicely packaged.  I've nothing to complain about, it's a great product!"
2207,excelente lo utilice para un sistema de riego con una bomba y un relé.
2208,"Ottimo per creare qualsiasi cosa,basta conoscere Arduino"
2209,Great dev board and I just realized that I can plug it into a raspberry pi and use UART to get serial output!
2210,Tutto ok
2211,"Ist halt ein Arduino. Wer den kauft, weiß vermutlich, warum er ihn gekauft. Und er ist genauso, wie man sich einen Arduino Uno R3 vorstellt. Alles gut."
2212,"bhe!!! Arduino originale è tutta un'altra cosa, a partire dalla confezione in cui arriva, curata nei minimi particolari, sicuramente costa un pochino di più rispetto ai suoi cloni, ma li vale tutti, al suo interno troviamo la scheda Arduino con un suo comodissimo e utile porta scheda in plexliglass che io personalmente ho trovato utilissima, in quanto evita di mandare in corto (accidentalmente) la scheda, ben fatta, il pc la riconosce subito senza problemi, non che le altre marche non vengano riconosciute ma Arduino originale ha qualcosa in più :-). la uso con la shield v3 e grbl è fantastica.Straconsigliata"
2213,"Ne possiedo altri 2 e sono prodotti che durano una vita ma questo per un certo periodo è andato molto bene poi un giorno collegandolo ad un computer fisso purtroppo penso si sia guastato il bus usb poiché non riuscivo più a fare niente ne caricare ne leggere gli sketch, ma la scheda si accendeva..."
2214,Got a legit one. Works perfect. Using it with a seeed can bus shield with no problems. Doesn’t come with any cables. For anyone curious the USB needed is a A-B cable.
2215,"The original unit did not work and I gave it a one star rating. Elegoo contacted me , made certain  that the unit did not work, and sent another. Great customer service. The new unit did not work either, so I thought there may be some incompatibility issue with my computer. My son tweeked the port selection that the unit was using and it now works. Four stars--great customer service, but shouldn't have to tweek the port selection."
2216,"Ich habe mir das Board gekauft und meine Erwartungen worden weit übertroffen. Ich bin zwar Software-Entwickler aber zum einfachen Programmieren des Chip gehört wirklich nicht viel zu. Das einfache Entwicklungsprogramm von der offiziellen Webseite downloaden und los gehts. In diesem Programm sind schon viel Beispiele zum Ausprobieren dabei.Tip: Das Board alleine nützt einem wenig. Sinnvoll dazu sind ein Laborsteckboard, ein paar entsprechende Steckkabel, ein Set LED's mit Widerständen, evtl Transistoren.Ich persönlich habe noch eine 180 Grad Schrittmotor angeschlossen. Mit den Beispielen alles eine einfache Geschichte.Ich hab dazu noch das Buch ""Ein schneller Einstieg in die Microcontroller-Entwicklung"" http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3898647641/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 noch gekauft, aber kaum benötigt. Doch für den kompletten Einsteiger perfekt.Einziges kleines Manko, es gib die Boards auch mit Mini-USB. Hier ist eine große USB Buchse verbaut, daher musste ich mir noch entsprechendes USB-Kabel besorgen. Vorteil der großen Buchse , die ist weit stabiler als die Mini"
2217,"possiedo un arduino uno rev 3 del 2012 (circa) e ho notato che a livello software e di interrupts ce una piccola differenza che rende il mio arduino del 2012 piu stabile rispetto a questo modello, ovvero....sto utilizzando gli interrupt con un modulo lettore mp3, che deve leggere dati da una scheda sd,  e ho notato che questo arduino si blocca a volte , mentre quello vecchio no... credo sia un problema a livello hardware forse, alcune componenti come l'oscillatore al quarzo sembrano dello stesso tipo ma di fabbricazioni diverse... comunque a parte questo sembra funzionare correttamente"
2218,"True-blue Arduino, ready for your microcontroller needs.  What more is there to say?"
2219,Muy buen producto para aprender a programar.

2221,
2222,"I initially bought, what I thought, was ONE Arduino UNO, for a LED project, and wound up with 2. I checked my order after delivery, and saw that I somehow ordered two, no biggie, I can use the 2nd for another project.The boards I received are both Authentic ITALIAN ARDUINO boards.They both have been working great. The programming can seem a bit confusing, especially coming from someone who has never programmed, but, these project boards are great for learning just about ANYTHING! Highly recommend!"
2223,Na het board te hebben aangesloten op een Mac en/of Windows computer zag de Arduino IDE het board niet. Het schijnt dat er extra een virtuele com-poort moet worden geïnstalleerd wat problematisch is gebleken. Wie kan mij hierbij helpen?
2224,"Dead out of the box. Bad bootloader. Wouldn't upload code. Tried a loopback ping test, etc, no luck. These things are cheap and disposable, was able to order another one to meet my deadline... but set me back a few days.One out of every eight of these I've ordered thru the years is just a paperweight. Makes no difference if you order a cheap one from China or from the Adafruit store directly, the quality control is bunk."
2225,Like
2226,War ein Geschenk. Hat alles gut geklappt
2227,Branché et programmé pour lire la téléinformation compteur Linky.Parfait
2228,"Arduino Uno è assolutamente un must have per gli appassionati di tecnologia e di elettronica come me. può fare praticamente tutto e soprattutto è davvero semplice imparare, veramente un ottimo prodotto, consiglaitissimo per chi vuole approcciarsi all'elettronica e alla programmazione. in internet sono presenti davvero un sacco di tutorial e corso per imparare e le schede di espansione sono pressoché infinite quindi assolutamente consigliato.pacco arrivato in pochissimo tempo nonostante le feste natalizie, in perfetto stato, ottimo"
2229,Great product authentic and works great.looking forward to many more programs and inventions from this.
2230,"Produit connus ,inutile de dire davantage  .  Colis  conforme  à ma commande  . délais raisonnables . Pourvu que cela dure ! CDLT"
2231,"This board is a real Arduino, not a clone trying to pass as an arduino.Satisfied purchaser."
2232,Recibo oportuno. Completo. Configuración de muy buena calidad.
2233,"Llegó bien empacado, sin golpes, en tiempo y forma, fue muy grato para mí abrirlo y ver qué tiene una placa de acrílico para poderlo sujetar en algún proyecto.Es original ya que hace tiempo atrás compré en una tarjeta en las tiendas oficiales, un Arduino Leonardo, comparando el empaque, sellos, etc es exactamente igual.Por lo general, los genéricos son de un ""azul marino"", con una bolsa antiestática e incluye el cable para conectarlo a la computadora de color azul translúcido."
2234,Super Karte um programmierte Steuerungen zu realisieren. Mit dieser Karte habe ich meine CNC Fräse gebaut.Um mit dieser Karte einzusteigen empfehle ich allerdings ein Set mit noch weiteren Bauteilen womit man dann experimentieren kann.
2235,Muy buena calidad
2236,I keep breaking them so I gotta keep buying them. Great product though!
2237,CONSEGNA REGOLARE.FUNZIONA ALLA PERFEZIONE
2238,"I made the mistake of buying a chinese knock off to save a few bucks. After messing with trying to load a sketch for a CNC on it for a couple hours, I ordered an original Arduino, no more problems. AND another great thing.........it didn't take six weeks to get it !"
2239,Verry good
2240,👍
2241,Perfect beginner product. I programmed some LED lights for EMDR therapy with this and it works perfectly. No complaints.
2242,Ottimo prodotto
2243,Buy one and support open source.
2244,I have three Arduino clones and this one is the real thing.
2245,I am very satisfied with the product. I would recommend.
2246,"Habe mehrere Modelle gekauft, teils bei Amazon, teils bei anderem Versender. Habe mich vorher informiert, wie die Originale auszusehen haben und sie dann gekauft. Auch wenn der Pries teilweise bei 40 Euro liegt.Die Microcontroller arbeiten hervorragend mit Windows 10 zusammen. Ich kann nur empfehlen, die Originale zu kaufen, da hat man keine Probleme."
2247,Arduino technology is such a well-thought out flexible tool!
2248,"It works the same as all the others, happy with it."
2249,Can't beat the brand name Arduino. You know it's going to work for you. I love it and the programming is easy to learn. I did it in one day.
2250,Product came as advertised and works exactly as it should. Great product at a great price. I would recommend to anyone looking to get into the wonderful world of creating with arduino uno.
2251,"Comodo, pratico, ottimo per imparare a programmare i microcontrollori, anche se l'ambiente IDE facilita molto molto la vita.Consiglio però di spendere qualcosina in più e prendere il mega."
2252,
2253,Both working great. I am very happy with the product and started using straight out the box.
2254,"What else is there to say besides it's an Arduino Uno R3? It's phenomenal in it's design and easy to use. The one I received is a genuine Arduino Uno, you can tell by the gold-colored chip inside; plus, the Arduino website says it is ;-) I highly recommend the Uno for anyone interested in learning electronics and to anyone with electronic experience under their belt!"
2255,"Es una pasada, a la hora de programar y va super rápido"
2256,"Non c'è nulla da aggiungere, è una questione di scelta.Ho acquistato versioni cinesi, e vanno bene, ma è giusto premiare chi si è inventato questo bel giocattolino, senza speculare sempre sul prezzo, alla ricerca del minimo possibile.C'è una differenza tra chi studia ed inventa e chi copia ed invade il mercato.Per la consegna, non ci sono abbastanza stelline, non fai in tempo ad ordinare che già ti suonano al campanello."
2257,"Not much to dislike here. Arduino is really something of its own, regardless of your background of coding or engineering (mind you, you'll have quite a lot to learn if you're *absolutely* brand new to this) ."
2258,Amazonの表示に「スペーサー３㎜」とある。届いた商品を組み立てたところ、基板が反り、アクリル板も反り、DCコネクタ下部のアクリル板が破損。調べたらスペーサーが２㎜以下で基板の部品の「脚」より短い。Amazonに問い合わせた結果、①返金後再注文。②出品者に連絡し、４８時間内に表示などを対処し連絡する、と告げられた。①の返金はしてもらったが、再注文しようにも②の連絡がなく、同じ規格外商品が届いても使用不可能なので注文を控えている。商品レビューを読むと、同様の利用者がいらっしゃったようで、出品者およびAmazonの対応に不信感を抱いている。
2259,"Everything is as advertised. This board is a fantastic way for beginners to learn about basic electronics and micro-controllers. Arduino provides great support for their (and others') products - from tutorials and references, to free development software and a project sharing website. I highly recommend this product for those interested in electronics and programming."
2260,Arduino Uno REV3 [A000066] tutto bene
2261,All the little electronic parts
2262,"It turned out to not be what I need, but the return process went smoothly. Note that this does not come with any of the wires necessary to work the Aruino properly."
2263,scheda originale e ben funzionante
2264,初心者向けでプログラムの勉強に最適です。
2265,"As of 11-October-2019, this is the real deal... a genuine Arduino Uno R3.  I'll be using this as my ""reference board"", to which I'll be comparing all other [clone] Arduinos.If they ship to you what they shipped to me, you will not be disappointed."
2266,I like the improvement of writing the pin names on the header.
2267,This is not your best option because you need the accessories that come with it. This one is only the micro-controller nothing else. For 150$ you can get the arduino and so many accessories
2268,"very cute,  good operation. resonable price.specially it very suiteable for Industrial application. because 5v,  not fast clock frequency in reliabilitythank you"
2269,Great value.  Delivered promptly and in great condition.
2270,"Arrivato velocemente, ho iniziato ad utilizzarlo da subito e senza problemi.Essendo originale non necessita di driver ma solo del programma Arduino IDE disponibile su [...]Arrivato nella confezione originale assieme a dei gommini protettivi e degli adesivi.E' sprovvisto del cavo USB che va comprato a parte.Il fatto che il microcontrollore sia fissato su una zoccolatura consente di sostituirlo facilmente in caso di guasti senza dover ricomprare l'intera scheda.Utile anche per programmare le altre schede arduino piu piccole (Arduino Nano, Pro Mini, ecc...) che necessitano di programmatore hardware esterno, infatti Arduino UNO può sostituire tale componente.Un MUST HAVE per chi si avvicina al mondo della programmazione, della robotica, IoT e fai da te elettronico"
2271,Good product that supports the open source movement
2272,original arduino uno
2273,"Perchè 99% ? Perchè è prodotto da ARDUINO SRL e non ARDUINO.CC. Infatti quest'ultimi sono in disputa legale contro ARDUINO SRL. Apparte questo, è arduino uno rev 3 al 100%, prodotto dalla stessa fabbrica che produce gli arduino.cc (apparte il colore diverso, come indicato in foto)Infatti sulla scheda vi è scritto: ARDUINO.ORG e non ARDUINO.CCMi è stato venduto da Onda Radio (dalla Spagna) che risulta tra i rivenditori ufficiali di arduino, come indicato nel sito arduino.cc.Subito riconosciuto da Win xp, funziona perfettamente. NON E' INCLUSO IL CAVOFunziona perfettamente con l'ide preso da arduino.ccE' sbagliato dire che è un prodotto falso, è originale al 99%, per i motivi detti prima, ma all'interno è ARDUINO UNO REV 3 al 100%Arrivato in 2 giorni"
2274,Great fun to play with and learn how to program a microcontroller.
2275,"El producto es importado y llegó antes de la fecha prevista, tardó menos de 5 días, ES EL ORIGINAL, te llega con su manual garantía y algunos detallitos como stickers."
2276,"Ho acquistato questo Arduino Uno per un progetto universitario di elettronica digitale, ma ho già avuto esperienze di utilizzo del prodotto in passato.Se avete intenzione di creare il vostro primo progetto di elettronica digitale, questo farà al caso vostro. Ovviamente con solo questo pezzo non potrete farci molto, ma avrete bisogno di altri componenti (resistenze, condensatori, sensori) per poter dare vita alle vostre creazioni.E' richiesta anche una conoscenza della programmazione (utilizza uno pseudo C) per poterlo usare.Ci sono alternative sul mercato cinese ad un prezzo molto più basso, ma se volete creare qualcosa di affidabile, vi consiglio di spendere qualche euro in più ed acquistare questo."
2277,Bisschen zu teuer...
2278,"If you wanna get into some basic microcontroller stuff this is a great first step, simple to use once you learn the basic programming, tons of resources online and the possibilities of things you can do with it is really endless. If you've never used one before it can take a bit of learning but after that it's all good to go. Great for new people and experienced. If you love trouble shooting and DIY projects this is your thing right here."
2279,Excellent product !
2280,Works as expected. Genuine Arduino board.
2281,"Innanzitutto voglio esplicitare il motivo per cui ho valutato codesto articolo con 5 stelle.Per prima cosa voglio sottolineare la puntualità della consegna che ha rispettato abbondantemente i tempi concordati, dunque complimenti ad Amazon, inoltre il prodotto era adeguatamente confezionato, completo di cavo usb e alimentatore, che da quanto scritto nell'annuncio non sarebbero dovuti arrivare. Poi bisogna dire inoltre che il prezzo è assolutamente ottimo e confermo l'utenticità del prodotto, che non è una copia o altro. L'unica cosa che devo rimproverare, ma la ritengo di poco conto, è il fatto che la scheda era contenuta solamente in un sacchetto, senza scatole o altro, ma comunque imballata con uno spesso strato di pluriball. Il prodotto è arrivato a destinazione intatto e funzionante, degno delle aspettative."
2282,"box damaged item ok, should be despatch in box not envelope"
2283,it is a great product for all skill /knowledge levels.
2284,very easy to use.
2285,"Nachtrag zu original Arduino:Mir ist vor kurzen bei einem Original Arduino der 3,3V Spannungswandler in Flammen aufgegangen. Dies könnte gefährlich sein sofern man den Arduino in der nähe von entflammbaren Materialien verbaut z.b. Holzgehäuse. Betrieben habe ich mein Arduino mit einem 12V Netzteil. 2 andere Arduinos laufen noch problemlos in der gleichen Konfiguration.Original & Nachbaute:Kauft den Arduino welcher von Amazon selbst verschickt wird. Kostenpunkt ca. 23 Euro. Wenn ihr ein billigeres Angebot von Verkäufern aus China oder GB bestellt werdet ihr einen billig Nachbau bekommen. Das diese Nachbauten auch Arduino heißen ist eigentlich illegal.Zu erkennen sind die billig Arduinos daran das die Beschriftung ein klein wenig dünner und größer ist. Außerdem steht auf der Rückseite statt ""Made in Italy"", ""Design in Italy"". Die Originalen werden tatsächlich in Italien produziert. Hochauflösende Produktfotos zum Vergleich sind auf [...] zu finden.Was erwartet euch bei einem billig Nachbau? An sich ein voll funktionstüchtiger Arduino. Allerdings ist es sehr fraglich wie lange diese funktionieren werden. Bei mir sind die Spannungswandler nicht zu gebrauchen. Das Originale Modell kann mit 5V - 18V betrieben werden. Die 2 billig Nachbauten kommen bei mir nur mit 5V klar. Bei 12V arbeiten sie gar nicht."
2286,A fun little board. Arduino has a huge community and the uno is a great place to start or grow. Recommended for anyone interested in electronics projects.
2287,Arduino Uno originale rimane il migliore sul mercato e vi consiglio vivamente di non comprare nessuna imitazione dato che questo costa solamente 23 euro e vi assicuro che li vale tutti.
2288,"This thing is the coolest. This is my first arduino (having previously only worked on WiPy's and industrial embedded devices). Being a creature of habbit, I was uneasy about using the accompanying IDE at first (preferring vim and my command-line), but once I gave it a shot it made compiling, debugging, and updating the hardware amazingly easy.I highly recommend for anyone interested in playing around with hardware hacking!"
2289,Shipping was extremely fast and item is as described.
2290,Your product is lovely....and its a value.
2291,"Todo bien, recomendado"
2292,"Small, powerful, easy to use"
2293,"Ordered 18 November 2019, definitely a genuine Arduino Uno. I was concerned after reading some reviews, however after seeing the seller listed as Arduino I decided to take a chance, and this is definitely not a knock off."
2294,違いますね。色々とスムーズでした。
2295,Great little device that is capable of much more than I am able to code. There are plenty of books or resources online to get you going.
2296,arduino uno funziona!!
2297,"Arduino lässt sich programmieren und wird von der originalen Software erkannt. Aufgefallen ist mir dieses Plagiat, weil anstatt ein 5V Festspannungsregler ein 3,3V Regler verbaut ist. Ich dachte zuerst der ist kaputt gegangen, aber beim auswechseln und genauer hinschauen ist mir aufgefallen das der falsche verbaut wurde. Wenn eine externe Spannungsquelle angeschlossen ist und nicht das USB Kabel, dann wird an 5V Ausgang und GPIO Pins nur 3,3 V ausgegeben.Mit den PWM Ausgänge habe ich aktuell weitere Probleme, bevor ich nur auf Suche nach Qualitätsfehler bin und mein Projekt zu viel Zeit in Anspruch nimmt, kaufe ich direkt bei Arduino.cc ein."
2298,Does what it needs to do...
2299,Very good to use for school projects
2300,Excelente articulo arduino.cc
2301,Thanks
2302,works well
2303,Acheté pour des tests.Tout fonctionne bien.Le petit support en platique pour éviter les cc est pas mal.
2304,"Great product. The reason this one costs more than others on Amazon is because this is the official arduino and y buying it you are supporting the project of it development. please be warned that this item does NOT come with the USB cable, but it just takes a standard USB a to b cable, like the one found on most USB printers.Hope this review was helpful. If it was, please click the button to tell me you found it helpful. (It helps out a lot)"
2305,ottimo prodotto
2306,"I had purchased a cheaper knockoff that was supposedly ""identical to the real Arduino"" at half the cost.  I never did get it to work.  The real Arduino booted up perfectly the first time.  It costs a little more; but it works."
2307,like it
2308,Comes as seen. Does not include mini-USB cable so you need to have one or buy separately. Did not know that when I purchased. 4.5/5
2309,Prodotto arrivato il giorno dopo del mio ordine. Il Corriere e' stato molto cortese e simpatico. Non presenta nessun problema e ottimo imbalaggio.
2310,"gibt nicht viel zu berichten, jedoch hat der Verkäufer schnell und zuverlässig geliefert. Funzt auch mit den standardmäßigen Treibern der CNC- Shields. Ob das lange gut geht weiss ich nicht!"
2311,it was quick. Thank you.
2312,Works right out of the box.Wasted 2 weekends trying to get this one 
2313,"Bien reçu le produit Arduino authentique, seul point négatif, ces que pour le part rapport au concurrents il y aurait mis y avoir les câbles d'alimentation et USB.Plus qu'à tester..."
2314,"lo uso da 10 anni, sempre al top"
2315,"Have been looking to get an Arduino for ages. It is built to a high quality, and being built in Italy it's ethical.Although there are lots of copies due to the open-source design, this works well with the Arduino programming environment and was super easy to set up.Just wish it came with a cable"
2316,Un peu cher par rapport aux micro-controlleurs plus récents (Nano Every) mais c'est un peu la référence pour lequel on trouve le plus de schémas sur Internet. Indispensable donc pour vérifier la bonne compréhension.
2317,Buon prodotto e spedizione veloce
2318,Buon prodotto consigliato per tutti gli appassionati di elettronicaArduino è sempre una garanzia e non ha bisogno di troppe parole
2319,E' un buon strumento per attuare piccoli automatismi artigianali.
2320,"Cosa si può scrivere che già non è stato scritto su Arduino? E' semplicemente il punto di partenza per gli appassionati di elettronica/robotica/domotica/informatica/.... che vogliono ""sporcarsi le mani"" e creare qualcosa che può veramente migliorare la vita o semplicemente che vogliono tuffarsi in un hobby pieno di sfide ma molto appagante!Ho acquistato la versione spedita e venduta da Amazon ""spaventato"" dalla possibilità di ricevere una versione compatibile e quindi non originale presso venditori terzi (anche se da altri commenti ho verificato che per fortuna molti venditori terzi forniscono l'originale)."
2321,Works as advertised.
2322,"There are far cheaper versions of essentially the same exact product. The main reason to buy a name brand arduino product is the arduino API, which makes writing programs for the microcontroller faaaaar easier to learn."
2323,"board works, looks legit but i havent really looked at it too hard. would buy again"
2324,"a Good Arduino processor board. well made. standard size. the base of the product Line. They have a great web site for learning Control. the board is the brain of the project. great for intelligent control of devices. basic robot,  smart home. able to link to home network. great for data gathering apps."
2325,What a great little device. The possibilities are truly endless. I bought this arduino to act as PWM generator for a motor controller salvaged from a treadmill. It worked like a charm. Especially since someone else had done all the leg work as far as writing code and wiring it up goes.
2326,"Excellent development tool. I needed to practice my Arduino programming and ran through several sketches and tutorials. I was having a tough time with the cheap EEPROM USB readers, so bought this to have full control in ready my security alarm board's EEPROM chip."
2327,fermodellismo
2328,Buono rapporto-qualità prezzo e imballaggio. Ottima per realizzare progetti funzionali con un giusto budget. Di facile utilizzo se si conoscono le basi di programmazione
2329,"An absolute must for anyone looking into electronics or coding! There is literally no end to what you can do with this unit but note; the board is completely useless without electronic components to use with so if you do not already own some of the 'Arduino basics' (Servo, LCD, 7 segment displays, resistors, LED's, buttons etc), I would highly recommend getting the Arduino Starter kit which is around £65 on Amazon and comes with all the components along with the genuine board (this product). Couldn't recommend enough!"
2330,Not used yet but we'll packaged with a clear plastic shield included.
2331,"Arduino ha con gli adulti l'effetto che hanno i Lego con un bambino.Io ho preso la versione senza accessori, ma ci sono dei pezzi, li assembli e ci giochi esattamente come il sacchetto con i mattoncini però invece di costruire case e città puoi costruire e progettare qualunque cosa che richieda automazione.Io personalmente ci costruirò un orologio digitale controllando un pannello led 32x32"
2332,Win8.1ではOKです。色々調べたところJAVAに問題があると想いJAVA-JREなどインストールしたがダメでした。ダメもとでArduinoIDE Ver1.8.10をインストールで動作しました。なお、1.8.12はＮＧでした。今はＩＯの出力や入力などができるようになりました。たまに受信エラーが出ます。プログラムが動いているためでしょうか？
2333,Sul mercato ne esistono diversi molto più economici che sono la copia di questo. Ho provato sia questo che i suoi cloni e mi sarei aspettato almeno il cavo di alimentazione in confezione visto che costa più del doppio degli altri. Peccato perché per il resto è ottimo
2334,"I'm not an expert Arduino user, but I've purchased this product thinking it was going to be a counterfeit like all the user reviews said it would be, but I'm cross referencing it with youtube videos and every aspect of the Arduino points to it being genuine. It's the genuine colour, it comes in the genuine packaging and comes with the stickers and pamphlet book. The bar code sticker reads ""Made in Italy"" ""RobotShop.com"""
2335,Die Qualität ist sehr überzeugend und alles funktioniert einwandfrei! 5 Sterne!
2336,Pas de soucis . Carte de bonne fabrication qui a fait ses preuves…
2337,"Cuando dí la asignatura de Fundamentos de Regulación Automática en el año 2010/2011, no existía el arduino (salió en 2011), por lo que teníamos que lidiar con controladores comerciales, caros y con poco márgen de maniobra... ¡Ay, si hubiese llegado un pelín más tarde...! Pero bueno, quería recuperar el tiempo perdido y me compré un Starter Kit; maravilloso. Ahora estoy en medio de un proyecto doméstico que requería un segundo controlador (y por eso me compré este arduino uno solitario) y la verdad es que va como la seda. 0 problemas hasta la fecha."
2338,controls the idle of my DIY dc generator to charge my 12 volt battery bank on low sun days been working over 120 running hours now flawlessly i probably should have gotten the mini though my box is kinda cramped up now
2339,"Ho acquistato Arduino per iniziare a smanettare con l'elettronica e con il linguaggio open source della IDE di Arduino.Molto bello e potente, perfetto anche il packaging.Mi aiuto su YouTube attraverso i tutorial e attraverso il sito ufficiale di Arduino.Davvero un bel mondo."
2340,"Ottimo Arduino, credo proprio sia quello originale.Il venditore ha inserito anche l'alimentatore da ""AC 240V / DC 5V - 2 Ampere"" e il cavo USB compresi nella spedizione!  è un 10 e lode al venditore.So che a qualcuno non è stato fornito ne il cavo USB ne l'alimentatore, non so da cosa dipenda, ma nella descrizionenon c'è scritto che ci siano, quindi è a discrezione del venditore se mettere o no tali aggiunte; sarò stato fortunato.L'Arduino è arrivato in busta chiusa dentro una scatola di cartone imbustata anche questa con i suddetti componenti.Testato con il software originale Arduino.ccTutti i LED funzionano, nessuna imperfezione riscontrata sulla scheda.Porta USB e tasto reset di ottima qualità."
2341,I am thrilled with this purchase.  As expected mine is an original UNO and I am impressed with the construction quality - it feels very rugged.
2342,Efficient
2343,"Il giocattolo, che ha un potenziale molto elevato, migliore che si possa regalare ad uno smanettone o un semplice appassionato, insieme a delle buone guide disponibili anche online che aiutino l'inizializzazione a questo microcontrollore capace di tutto. L'originale ed unico, che in questa ultima rev arriva con attaccato ad una basetta in plastica che ne rende un utilizzo ed un eventuale fissaggio molto più semplice.Consigliatissimo."
2344,enclosemore urls
2345,"Many reviews about counterfeit. This is NOT.Please note that when you go to the Arduino counterfeit page, this model is not shown exactly, because it's a version made for USA. If you go to the distribution page that shows all the different models, you will find these nuance differences are actually legitimate."
2346,"Arriva in una scatolina semplice con solo la scheda di Arduino,il prezzo è ottimo per chi non ha bisogno di altri kit, se siete ai primi passi invece, consiglio la versione con lo starter kit."
2347,"This has to be one of the coolest things I’ve ever bought. There are soooo many options for projects, I love it !"
2348,"I need to get this from Arduino website but it would take days plus the shipping cost. Using my prime membership, I received it next day . If you are serious about Arduino, get this."
2349,NO CABLE!II I have to by another one.
2350,"Super, conforme a la description"
2351,It's an Arduino board. Genuine one.Not much else to say other than it arrived on time.
2352,Bought to help me flash a boot loader onto an ender 3 mobo. Worked as intended.
2353,Great price
2354,"Buen producto, funcionó excelente, no incluye cable de conexión"
2355,cool
2356,I have a few of these laying around for projects I want to get done.  Works like a champ.
2357,Experiments
2358,"scheda elettronica per sperimentazione di Arduino.Molto ben fatta , circuito stampato realizzato in ottimo FR4 e saldature dei componenti elettronici professionali , senza riprese manuali evidenti.Funzionalita' interessanti tutte da scoprire.Manca il cavo di connessione al PC, di facile reperibilita' in qualsiasi supermercato o rivendita di materiale informatico.Il sw fornito con il CD potrebbe avere problemi di compatibilita' con i sistemi operativi piu' vecchi, facilmente risolvibile scaricandolo da internet in versione piu' aggiornata."
2359,Gute Verarbeitung und tut was er soll. Bin zufrieden
2360,"Aspetto che mio figlio mi insegni, l'ho comprato per imparare, non so se sarà semplice, ma io mi impegnerò."
2361,"Jeder kennt wohl das Ding und deshalb brauche ich das hier nicht alles aufrollen. Ich bin mit dem Teil sehr zufrieden und es tut was es soll. Allerdings hat hier wohl jemand schlechte erfahrungen mit Nachbauten gemacht.Falls wie erwähnt das Original mit der Aufschrift ""Made in Italy"" zu identifizieren ist, dann habe ich ein Original erhalten :)Aber einige Antworten hier deuten darauf hin, dass es eigentlich kein Original mehr gibt? Naja was solls. Verarbeitung ist jedenfalls einwandfrei."
2362,Great
2363,Arrivato nei tempi prestabiliti. Qualità ottima prezzo onesto. Per il resto come da descrizione
2364,A whole lot of fun and IMO its the only arduino board I would buy if I could only have one.
2365,"Da quando hanno risolto i problemi su linux è un piacere da usare. Davvero ""plug & play"", si installa l'IDE e si parte. Possibilità enormi."
2366,I see a lot of reviewers complaining about receiving cheap counterfeit Arduinos. The one I received is an Arduino brand board and it came with a nice acrylic base. I'm getting more of these before they run out.
2367,"Der Artikel wahr schon nach zwei Tagen im Briefkasten, schneller als erwartet. Die Verpackung und war gut, so dass der Artikel bis jetzt keine Versandschäden aufweist. Kann über den Artikel noch nicht viel sagen, da er erst noch benutzt wird, denke aber , dass er den Erwartungen entsprechen wird, daher nur 4 Sterne."
2368,"Acquistato da CampuStore. Il prodotto è l'Arduino originale prodotto in Italia e funziona perfettamente. Alcuni hanno riscontrato una contraffazione del prodotto in quanto Amazon propone ben 22 rivenditori e al momento dell'acquisto il rivenditore proposto è quello che offre il prezzo inferiore. A questo punto sta al compratore verificare che tipo di Arduino vende e eventualmente scegliere un rivenditore più affidabile. Nel mio caso il prezzo proposto era di 22,69, ma per 1 solo centesimo in più ho preferito affidarmi a CampuStore rivenditore molto affidabile di componentistica per scuole e università."
2369,Ho già creato un progetto di una centralina di comando multizone per l'impianto di riscaldamento senza problemi. L' unica pecca è che nonostante l'imballaggio la confezione è arrivata un po schiacciata. Per il resto funziona alla grande
2370,"Fast Shipping, and no surprises with the product.  I used it to flash a new boot-loader, and firmware to my new 3D printer.  Worked perfectly."
2371,"Ich hab den Arduino für ca. 23€ bestellt, der von Amazon direkt versendet wird und habe einen originalen erhalten.Der funktioniert einwandfrei. Natürlich sollte man schon ein gewisses Grundwissen zum Thema Elektrotechnik mitbringen.Im Netz sind jedoch zahlreiche Anleitungen für Anfänger zu finden, mit denen man schnell erfolge verbuchen kann.Bei vielen ist dabei auf recht einfach und verständlich erklärt warum die Schaltung gerade so aufgebaut wurde.Am besten gleich Experimentier-Board, Widerstände, Mikrotaster, Litze, Kondensatoren und je nachdem was man Basteln möchte noch andere Bauteile mit bestellen!"
2372,Super easy to program. Never did this before but completed 3 sample projects the first 3 days.
2373,"Costa poco, funziona sempre è completo: ho scoperto che il REV 3 ha 2 ingressi I2C, quindi senza tanti sbattimenti ci sta un display  e un'altro sensore a 4 fili (I2C). Di fatto compro sempre Arduino originale, mi fa stare più tranquillo. Nella foto, piccola stazione meteo."
2374,This product doesn't seem to be an authentic Arduino but still seems like a good replica. I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews and still ordered it. Even though it isn't an authentic Arduino I am still happy with it.
2375,Great
2376,I have quite a collection of different Arduino's for many projects.
2377,Bran New out of the box. Came with a housing unit. Note that the cable cord was not included.***BONUS***Stickers come in the box
2378,素人でも、意欲があれば出来ますね。次はこんなの作ってみるかとか。色々調べたくなりました。
2379,"Poco da dire. Ottimo e a buon prezzo.Prodotto originale.Consigliato per chi vuole cominciare con Arduino. Anche se, si possono fare molte cose interessanti ed anche di una certa complessità. Ovviamente con il limite della memoria disponibile."
2380,"Alles super, sehr schnelle Lieferung. Einfach, aber gut verpackt. Die Platine liegt in einem kleinen transparenten Rückteil, das gut zum Anschrauben verwendet werden kann (und bei Testaufbauten Kurzschlüsse vermeidet). Alles super, danke!"
2381,"I didn't exactly get what it shows in the picture But! It was a Arduino Uno Smd, the difference is that big mega chip on the picture, TO KNOW YOU ARE GETTING THE REAL CHIP! Is that it should come with thank you for supporting Arduino, I do not know what the whole coding & what physical changes it will have if I were to get the Arduino Uno R3 chip?"
2382,"Das Produkt erfüllt seinen Zweck. Kommt an einem Simulator zum Einsatz. Arbeitet zuverlässig.Ich fände es sehr Hilfreich, wenn das Gerät mehr als 5V aus dem Output geben könnte. So musste ich eine Lösung mit Ralais und externer Stromversorgung wählen. Mit nur 2V mehr und 1Ampere mehr wäre das nicht nötig gewesen. Dies aber nur ein Wunsch. Overall ein solides Produkt! Vielen Dank! Viele Grüße!"
2383,"The amount of things you can do with this is huge.The drawback is, is that if you want a permanent job for one you have to get another!It's easy to reprogram them, however.Quite small, and packaging was not over the top.It's probably worth the extra money getting a real Arduino rather than saving a couple of quid on an alternative."
2384,"High quality board, processor works 100%.  shipped in a small cardboard box that protects pins.  Has plastic base that would prevent shorts if you put it on a metal surface."
2385,This is one of the most darling things ever made...so many applications for drone microcontrollers! Have it hover and take a selfie photo!
2386,Funktioniert bestens nur zu empfehlen. Schnell geliefert das USB Kabel sollte länger sein.
2387,Well packaged and beautifully presented. Looks really good and well worth the price.Thank you.
2388,"Ottimo prodotto, peccato per la scarsa memoria che crea dei bug usandolo per gestire un plotter Laser XY con grbl . In fase di incisione di foto sul legno o su altri materiali teneri non si riesce ad aumentare la velocità di scansione altrimenti crea degli sfasamenti dell'immagine . Per il resto è un ottimo prodotto."
2389,"Dopo averne comprato 2 alla Maker Faire, necessitavo di un terzo arduino.Mi sono rivolto ad Amazon perchè il prezzo era di 5€ inferiore rispetto a quello della fiera.Nonostante stia recensendo il prodotto a distanza di 2 anni, funziona ancora bene e regge il peso dei suoi "" anni"".Per comodità nei miei progetti lo alimento con una clip da 9V piuttosto che con il cavo USB appunto per riuscire a sviluppare i miei progetti in totale indipendenza dal computer."
2390,"Finalmente il mio primo Arduino! Perfetto in tutto!!! Funzionante al 100%! E cosa ancora piu' importante...ORIGINALE 100%! Non e' affatto un'imitazione come avevo letto in alcuni commenti qua sotto...probabilmente dipende dal venditore..io l'ho preso da CampusStore!Tra l'altro la scheda viene fornita con una basetta sotto in plastica trasparente cosi' da poggiarla sul tavolo senza graffiarla. Inoltre dispone anche di alcuni fori per il fissaggio con viti! Manca il cavetto usb, ma e' reperibile ovunque...anzi, quasi sicuramente lo avete gia' in casa!"
2391,"läuft, tut was er soll"
2392,"Ne ho acquistati già degli altri, certo costano un po' di più di quelli ""compatibili"", ma sono garanzia di qualità e nessuna incompatibilità con driver o strumenti software, o con altri hardware. Spedizione veloce e fattura ricevuta in tempo reale."
2393,Can't get any better than an Arduino Nano when it comes to basic prototyping. This is my 10th or so? Never had an issue (that wasn't my own fault... such as the one I set on fire recently)
2394,"Ottimo microcontrollore, quello che ce da dire é gia stato detto, mi limito a riconfermare la qualità della scheda e sopratutto il fatto che é italiana.Pensavo che nella confezione fosse incluso il cavo usb ma così non é, io ho comprato questa poiché ho voluto supportare il progetto ma ci tengo a dire che esistono molte versioni di Arduino costruite e vendute a minor prezzo.Nella confezione oltre alla scheda é presente un foglietto illustrativo e degli adesivi.Amazon sempre eccellente"
2395,4 stars because a cheaper knockoff has more pins and I don't like how often the PWM is taken over by libraries.
2396,"Ist halt das drinnen was angeboten wurde, sieht dementsprechend allerdings hochwertiger wie Elgoino boards aus.Für Anfänger würde ich eher ein Kit für 20€ empfehlen"
2397,2
2398,"Ho acquistato la scheda insieme ad una della elegoo e nell'utilizzo non ho trovato alcuna differenza. Per quanto riguarda il prezzo, quella della elegoo è costata circa la metà, quindi fate un po voi.Penso possa anche essere un bel regalo se si vuol fare avvicinare un ragazzino al mondo della programmazione, dell'informatica e dell'elettronica."
2399,Funziona benissimo. Ed è un prodotto italiano ! Non comprare imitazioni.
2400,Nice item
2401,"Non ha nessun bug, è diventato uno standard con tirature elevatissime.Forse potrebbe cominciare a costare di meno"
2402,Der Originale Arduino uno funktioniert super und ist für Anfäger gut geeignet.
2403,"Ho acquistato questo arduino per poter fare il mio progetto d'esame. Un prodotto di altissima qualità che non ha deluso. Funziona perfettamente, e anche se ho rischiato di bruciarlo continua a funzionare. Dopotutto la qualità paga, se sarebbe successo su un altro microcontrollore probabilmente non sarebbe più andato e mi sarebbe toccato comperarne un altro.Con amazon prime il prodotto mi è arrivato il giorno dopo"
2404,"impressionné par la belle finition, le marquage des interfaces"
2405,What a great price on an Arduino Uno!This is my third Arduino board. I have a lot of fun playing with these. I really don't have much experience in electronics but there a TONS of websites and youtube videos to give you project ideas and things to try.
2406,"dalle recensioni avevo paura che mi arrivasse quello falso, ma tutte le mie paure sono svanite quando è arrivato.ottimo, compatto e funzionante.metto 4 stelle e non 5 perchè la confezione è uno scatolino sottilissimo di carta, senza alcuna protezione per la scheda, davvero imbarazzante e pericoloso per l'incolumità della scheda stessa"
2407,"I finally opened the packages and ran a simple test. Both were good, as expected. Delivery was quick and painless.Bill"
2408,Comprato per la scuola di mio figlio ed è perfetto gli servirà anche questo anno ed è ancora come nuovo .consigliato!
2409,"You can never go wrong with one of these, infinite uses and learning for any electronics or DIY hobbyist."
2410,Bought as gift for 12-yr-old grandson. He hasn't opened the gift yet so too soon to comment on its functionality. I just gave 5 stars bc I have no complaints about it.
2411,"Buongiorno a tutti, ho comprato questa scheda per avvicinarmi al mondo dell' elettronica.Lo trovo un oggetto geniale, programmarlo ed utilizzarlo è molto semplice e non serve essere degli esperti per iniziare.Inoltre sul web sono disponibili numerose dispense, file, corsi gratuiti e tutorial per iniziare.Consiglio questo acquisto, insieme ad un kit di componenti elettronici se già non ne avete, a tutti coloro che vogliono avvicinarsi a questo mondo, sono decisamente soldi ben spesi."
2412,"Ok, I'm a bit biased. I have several of these now in different guises.  But, if you haven't tried playing with one of these to get your projects off the ground, probably now is the time.  This is much simpler than a Raspberry Pi and only takes the commands you need to do your job.  Also, one tip, If you are unsure of how these work. check out http://123d.circuits.io for a test environment where you can build your circuits virtually before ever buying a component."
2413,c'è poco da dire è un arduino prodotto affidabile
2414,Maggior qualita rispetto ai cloni cinesi
2415,"acheter avec le livre ""Arduino pour les nuls"", il ne manque plus qu'à commencer!"
2416,"Bueno ya sabes, un Arduino Uno :) aunque no se si es original, vino sin la base plástica."
2417,"war eine bestellung für meinen freund der Elektronik systemsteuerung lernt, er ist begeistert von dem Teil da es wirklich original ist, was schwer zu finden ist, und die nicht originalen nicht bei allem funktionieren und trotz kabel nicht kompatibel sind, das ist halt mit einem Original einfach anderst, das funktioniert so wie es soll, DANKE für dieses schnäppchen"
2418,"This product is exactly as described. The ""original"" Arduino UNO R3."
2419,"Really cool for working with personal projects, easy to use"
2420,Nice product for work.
2421,Es un módulo Arduino que cumple con las expectativas.
2422,Surprisingly inexpensive.
2423,"Conforme alla descrizione, originale, ben imballato"
2424,scarface-inline-error-icon-altPlease enter your headline.
2425,The authentic arduinos can't be beat on their quality compared to the knock offs. While I use the cheaper controllers it's nice to have a couple good ones as well
2426,Top wie beschrieben danke
2427,"La carte que j'ai reçu est une Arduino authentique, ce qui n'est pas toujours le cas apparemment selon les commentaires que j'ai pu lire. Le gros point négatif est que le chargeur/câble USB n'est pas envoyé avec. Ce n'est précisé nul part sur l'annonce!"
2428,"Se sai quello che stai facendo questo prodotto e veramente eccezionale, mi ha aiutato parecchio.Ovviamente va programmato e non è così immediato come sembra"
2429,"Did not work. Bought a MEGA and a UNO close instead, they both work fine.I was unable to upload any code to this board. Tried 2 different computers, 2 different cables, with and without external power. Bought a MEGA and a UNO clone instead, they both work fine, using the same setup/cables.I was lazy to return it, I contacted Amazon and they gave me partial credit."
2430,Online c'è talmente tanta documentazione su Arduino UNO che (escludendo difetti di fabbricazione) rimanere sorpresi mi sembra impossibile.Il prezzo a mio avviso è troppo alto: ho comprato comunque l'originale per avere un riferimento.
2431,"Judging by other reviews I could see this was overpriced and a fake but what I didn't realise is not only that, but it comes with no power supply, or usb cable.  I probably should have checked the picture to look for that, but I assumed from the price and positive reviews and the lack of mention of this in critical reviews, that it was basically ready to use.I notice it says so in the questions people asked about the item. I should have checked those.This is a big inconvenience that it is not ready to use, in that it needs more than is sent, to use it. It needs a USB cable at least. An LED to plug in wouldn't be a bad thing either and probably only costs less than a dollar.  This thing is so over-priced and can't really be bought on its own unless you already have other stuff."
2432,good as expected
2433,"Nachdem ich mir diverse YouTube Videos zu den unterschiedlichsten Arduino und Raspberry Pi Projekten angesehen habe, war die Anschaffung irgendwann unumgänglich. Die Frage nach Arduino vs. Raspberry Pi habe ich mir selbst so beantwortet, dass die beiden Systeme nicht als Alternative, sondern als Ergänzung zueinander zu sehen sind. Während der Pi quasi ein vollwertiger Rechner ist, hat der Arduino Vorteile bei der Verarbeitung von z.B. Analogen Signalen."
2434,Very nice device. It works well and has plenty of programming support online.
2435,Beautifully functional.  Easy to work with.  Fun to use.  Wonderful experience.
2436,"è la prima volta che mi avvicino ai circuiti integrati, che ho sempre ritenuto ""roba da ingegneri elettronici"" o comunque gente del settore. Con Arduino, invece, basta un po' di buona volontà e cercare un po' sui forum per dare forma ai nostri progetti.Il linguaggio di programmazione è molto semplice ed è simile a quello delle macro excel...quindi niente di estremamente complesso.Non scendo nel tecnico delle capacità di questa scheda, in quanto come avrete capito non sono assolutamente un esperto, ma sono decisamente convinto che le capacità siano abbastanza ampie da raccogliere le diverse esigenze che ognuno di noi possa avere nella vita quotidiana."
2437,These are fantastic.  Better than fake ones.
2438,Sehr schnell und Präzise
2439,"Great product!  Good build quality and tons of fun to use.  As an electronics hobbyist, you are limited only by your imagination with these things."
2440,"Scheda Microcontrollore ATmega328, ORIGINALE, meglio sottolineare visto la proliferazione di cloni.Sulle schede Arduino è difficile scrivere cose non già dette e scritte in libri e libri.Posso solo scrivere che acquisto queste schede da anni e questa è la terza che prendo su Amazon, prezzo buono, imballato bene e spedizione rapidissima.Quest'ultima è stata venduta da  RelChron Limited e spedita da Amazon."
2441,"Le doy cuatro estrellas porque a las pocas horas de realizar el pedido bajaron el precio. Envío recibido un día más tarde de lo previsto. Por lo demás el arduino ES EL ORIGINAL 100%. Empaquetado de envío suficiente y el empaquetado del propio arduino bastante desprotegido, te viene dicho arduino en una caja en la que entra justo y sin la típica bolsa de componentes electrónicos. Por lo demás todo ok. Funcionamiento perfecto. VIENE SIN CABLE."
2442,"This isn't a real Arduino UNO R3 it is definitely a clone.I own a real one and this one is made of cheaper parts and doesn't have the pin numbers printed on the sides of the sockets like the official Arduino UNO R3.It works fine though, but is not an official micro controller from Arduino."
2443,"Estremamente versatile e di facile programmazione. La struttura semplice consente di risolvere la stragrande maggioranza di qualsiasi eventuale problema di programmazione. L'esaustiva guida on-line ed i numerosi esempi dimostrativi (reperibili dal sito internet di arduino) riescono a dissolvere con rapidità ogni dubbio o necessità dell'utente.La manifattura italiana, inoltre, è garanzia di affidabilità, resistenza e qualità del prodotto; ragioni più che sufficienti a giustificarne il prezzo leggermente più elevato dei concorrenti cinesi di questo progetto Open-Source di origine italiana!"
2444,"- Einwandfrei- Lötungen sind gut- Bauteile sind korrekt ausgerichtet.- Keine Probleme bei der Programmierung- Original hat weniger Speicher als der ebenfalls von mir gekaufte Funduino. Bei den bisherigen kleinen Programmen bin ich nicht an eine Grenze gestoßen. Bei komplexeren Anwendungen muss man sehen, ob der vorhandene Speicher noch ausreichend ist, oder man in einem solchen Fall Teile der Logik auf einen externen Rechner verlagert."
2445,"this is from the company that split from Arduino LLC.the box was very lightly damaged but that is minor, included some stickers but nothing else.after powering up the self test LED on pin 13 flashed as expected, so far so good."
2446,"Just a standard arduino, works exactly as expected.A little bit annoying that it doesnt come with a cable to plug it into a computer."
2447,"Allora, l' Arduino spedito non è originale, ma bensì funzionante... È completamente compatibile con il programma originale, ma dal colore della scheda, le saldature e le ""scritte"" si nota che è ""artigianale""...Comunque il processore è originale e compatibile..quindi cambia pocoPer 23 euro un arduino uno funzionante e compatibile con i drive originale è gia perfetto..Però mi da fastidio che sia spacciato per originale..."
2448,"Beware it is not coming with a USB A-B cable, you have to buy that separately! It was an urgent order and I am very frustrated that I am not able to use it, who is using USB A-B nowadays anyway?! I have a dozen different USB cables at home, but none of that."
2449,Bon produit.
2450,Alles io
2451,"Spedizione rapida come sempre , imballaggio ok , prodotto valido e funzionante"
2452,So far so good but it is so difficult to set up the IDE for Linux and Windows if one is using Eclipse and Visual Studio Micro plug-in....it took couple of night until all was correct and working. The platform is really good and idea to learn and practice Embedded C/C++ programming skills.
2453,"La scheda arduino è giunta a destinazione nei tempi previsti. Esaminandola, ho potuto constatare che è originale. Ho subito provato a caricare uno sketch d'esempio (quello in cui lampeggia il led posto nell'uscita 13) e ha funzionato perfettamente, dimostrando che il bootloader sull'ATMEGA328A con essa incluso fosse (ovviamente) stato caricato il bootloader. la scheda è giunta col cavo adatto alla sua connessione al PC (UART)."
2454,Rapide et correspondant a la descrition
2455,"Arduino, già il nome è una garanzia. Ottimo. Ben pensato, ben progettato, ben assemblato, facile da usare. Consigliatissimo."
2456,"Arduino Uno ORIGINALE.Che dire: è ormai da tempo che lo utilizzo per un sistema di controllo, e anche sotto stress ha sempre funzionato alla perfezione.In più è la versione originale, prodotta in Italia, dove questo microcontrollore è nato ed è stato brevettato. Lo ritengo superiore alle versioni copiate ormai da chiunque...e sinceramente per la minima differenza di prezzo vale la pena acquistarlo!"
2457,"Leider enttäuschte mich dieser Artikel sehr. Habe ihn sogar 2x bestellt um herauszufinden, ob bei der ersten Lieferung was schief gelaufen ist. Vielleicht sollte Amazon lieber mit einem anderen Lieferanten kooperieren...B-Ware oder Plagiat?Der Arduino war nicht original in einem kleinen Karton verpackt, wie ich es sonst gewohnt bin. Er kam lediglich in einer antistatischen Folie in einem Briefumschlag verpackt an. Aus der antistatischen Folie drückten sich schon einige Lötstellen.Es lag ein USB Kabel bei, welches normal auch nicht zum Lieferumfang gehört.Technische MängelDer Mikrocontroller saß bei beiden schräg auf dem Board.Die Klemmbeschriftung fehlte an den Pins.Lötstellen sahen nicht gut aus bzw waren wegen der schlechten Verpackung beschädigt.LieferzeitBei diesen zwei Bestellungen war von meiner Prime Mitgliedschaft nichts zu merken. Obwohl das Angebot mich mit Prime gelockt hatte...Hab ihn dann bei der Konkurrenz bzw einem online Fachhandel unwesentlich teurer bestellt.Am nächsten Tag war der Arduino dann auch schon da :)FazitKauft einen originalen Arduino bei einem anderen Lieferanten. Bei Amazon wurde ich zu dem vorgestellten Preis nicht fündig.Bei weniger Ansprüchen kauft einen richtig billigen von einem anderen Hersteller. Gibt's auch bei Amazon."
2458,問題なく使えています。
2459,Facile da programmare nessun problema
2460,"Perfetto! Ottima qualità dell'imballo e della scheda stessa, arriva con un supporto in plastica che copre la parte sotto della scheda!"
2461,I needed it
2462,"arrivato nei tempi stabiliti,venditore affidabile lo consiglio"
2463,"Ottimo prodotto, l'ho acquistato per vedere un po cosa fosse, è davvero bello mettere in pratica i concetti base di elettronica edi programmazione per vedere dal vivo cosa succede. Va ovviamente integrato con mille device acquistabili a prezzi davveroridicoli, che pero' ne espandolo le possibilità a dismisura. Consiglio vivamente l'acquisto a chiunque voglia anche solo sognaredei progetti di micro domotica e di dispositivi fai-da-te per la casa o l'auto."
2464,"Parfait, bien reçu et fonctionne très bien."
2465,"I wish it was cheaper but since it's magically easy I can't fault them.All the sorcery of ""import library to fix problem"" coupled with flexible power supply options means you'll have LED's flashing in no time."
2466,"I already did 5 or 6 programs using it and all is working as expected, very good product, the real ARDUINO UNO R3 !!!!!!"
2467,Very useful and delivery was fast! I just wished there were wires included with it.
2468,"- arrivato entro il tempo stabilito- OTTIMO prodotto- funziona perfettamente- Nessun tipo di guasto- nella scatola troviamo, stickers, Arduino, un piccolo foglietto certificando l'autenticità, base di plastica per appoggiarlo su qualsiasi superficie, NON c'è il cavo- (PICCOLA PARENTISI, la scatola era appena un po piegata, ma niente di che)lo consiglio a tutti coloro che ne hanno bisogno!"
2469,"Etant electronicien à l'origine, c'est avec grand plaisir que j'ai commencé des expérimentations avec cette carte qui est vraiment accessible techniquement et cela même pour les novices.Je recommande d'acheter  les cartes arduino d'origine (encourager le monde open) et non les clônes qui n'assurent une compatibilité totale."
2470,aiuta molto a chi è alle prime armi come megrazie anche ai diversi video che si trovano sul web con le loro dimostrazioni pratiche ti fanno meglio capire i vari comandi per utilizzarlo
2471,"Bought this only for school. Box came in crushed, but the actual Arduino was okay."
2472,La description indiquait qu'un câble était fourni. Ce n'est pas le cas.Plusieurs jours de perdu à cause d'une mauvaise description.Je vais probablement renvoyer le produit.
2473,Authentic Arduino UNO.These are great to have........ It's nice to support the community!
2474,It's a great little thing. I can see it being used for a variety of hobby projects and also useful for anyone who wants to learn about micro-controllers like myself and I intend to put it to good use building a flight controller for a Quad-copter. Lots of fun.
2475,Good quality & arrived promptly
2476,Bueno y buen precio
2477,Prodotto straconosciuto. Funziona come previsto.
2478,"Tengo una Raspberry Pi, pero al haber poca información sobre ella para proyectos eléctronicos me decanté por probar Arduino y la verdad es que hay mucha información y proyectos en internet para aprender y muy interesantes, lo recomiendo tanto para empezar como para hacer domótica en casa."
2479,Producto original la calidad se nota y llegó en buenas condiciones
2480,"So easy to programme and use. Everything you need to prototype in one easy to use board. I would recommend the Arduino Uno to anyone who want's to quickly and easily get a working prototype off the ground. Also look at the ""Arduino Due"" prototyping board. I have and use both."
2481,"Che dire Arduino è una garanzia, funziona perfettamente. Ho sviluppato un circuito che gestisce il parcheggio dell'auto in garage, segnalando la distanza tra l'automobile e il muro. E' installato ormai da qualche mese sempre alimentato.Acquisto consigliato anche se il prezzo ormai è fuori mercato basta vedere altre schede tipo... Pi zero che costa 5$ e fa cose marziane, d'altra parte ricordate, è partito tutto da Arduino."
2482,Buy at least on real Arduino. They made it possible for us to have the others and it's great for troubleshooting.(My stickers did come mis-cut though)
2483,Bought generic but it had funny upload issues
2484,A1
2485,"That's the one! It is the bare minimum, though. You need some guessing to start with it, but nothing too hard to figure out."
2486,電子工作用のパーツ販売店が近隣にありません。購入後にすぐ手元に届きましたので、遠方まで買いに出る手間がないのは楽ですね。機会があればまた利用したいと思います。
2487,"Bought one for this ridiculous price (17 pounds) just as an appreciation gesture, while having several ones from china factories which cost three times less! Anyway, could not sleep well without supporting product creators not just cloners from china."
2488,This is a great controller that I was able to use to build a robot.
2489,"Although it works, I had to exchange this product many times because I couldn’t validate its authenticity. A big no-no for me was the fact that 1- it’s not teal, it’s a deep blue, and 2- the box was smashed in, one of the ports was crooked, and the box didn’t have the holographic sticker."
2490,This was actually the SMD edition that shipped.  Everything works as expected and the shipping was fast.
2491,Lieferung ging schnell und es hat sofort funktioniert.
2492,Easy to use for setting up my quadcopter speed controllers.
2493,"La spedizione è stata veramente veloce, considerando che la scheda proveniva da Barcellona se non mi sbaglio. La scheda l'ho acquistata dal rivenditore Onda Radio e mi sembra originale. Nella scatola non è presente l'alimentatore ma c'è un foglio di garanzia, i piedini in gomma morbida per la scheda e degli adesivi pubblicitari - tra l'altro molto carini. Sono molto soddisfatta!"
2494,hot glue on it with small scratch under it.
2495,Fácil de utilizar.
2496,Genuine product works as expected out of the box.  I especially like the clear print on the sides of the connector strips as well as on the board itself.
2497,"looks genuine, which is what I wanted. So far working perfect,"
2498,"Ottimo prodotto, molto versatile: facile da usare e da imparare. Il suo punto di forza è il fatto che sia open-source e che sia il punto di partenza di molti progetti di robotica e fai da te. Soldi spesi bene, anche per l'alta qualità e la genuinità del prodotto, che ricordo, è Made in Italy!"
2499,"El producto es el Arduino UNO R3 Original, viene en caja de cartón con el contenido de pegatinas oficiales e instrucciones.Para asegurar aun más, el producto lleva grabado en la placa ""Made in italy"". No se puede esperar más, está genial.Al ser el original, viene sin cables.Recomiendo este artículo.Saludos,"
2500,Was man hier nirgends sieht und auch nicht beschrieben wird ist das es sich um einen original Arduino handelt. Er kommt ich einer schönen kleinen Schachtel mit lustigen Aufklebern dabei. Das macht alles ein edlen Eindruck. Auch die Platine selbst macht einen sehr guten Eindruck.Habe nun schon meine ersten Experimente damit gemacht und bin begeistert wie schnell man damit klar kommt. Sehr empfehlenswert!
2501,Perfect for small functionalities and to start your learning with!
2502,Very helpful in learning for beginners and develop simple and small projects
2503,fa esattamente il suo lavoro
2504,"Il primo Arduino non si dimentica mai.Ricevuto nel suo box con tanto di supporto in plastica trasparente che conferisce una certa importanza al prodotto, mi è arrivato nei tempi previsti in ottimo stato e funziona alla perfezione. niente da aggiungere.Assolutamente consigliato"
2505,Amazing little controller. I bought this after buying the Starter Kit. It comes with a base plate so protect the board from short circuits and damaging your table.
2506,pour apprendre a m'en servir
2507,Usato per aggiornare il firmware sulla Creality Ender 3. Ottimo e versatile é dire poco. Usato anche per sbloccare il bootloader alla stampante 3D e ad aggiornare e inserire il supporto al BLTouch 3D.
2508,"fourni avec une protection sous la carte. fonctionne parfaitement. La carte est d'excellente facture. Bien numérotée, bien lisible elle est très belle."
2509,Microcontrollore dalle innumerevoli possibilità. Divertente e molto utile se ci si vuole avvicinare al mondo della robotica e dell'automazione.Si basa su un linguaggio di programmazione molto semplice e alla portata di tutti se non bastasse internet è pieno di guide e progetti molto interessanti.
2510,There is no cable in it! How should I supposed to make it work!?
2511,Volevo fortemente entrare nel magico mondo della progettazione di dispositivi per la Home Automation. Mi sono subito reso conto che con questo dispositivo tutto sarebbe stato enormemente più semplice ed alla mia portata.
2512,"Spedizione Amazon e consegna perfetti rispettando i tempi.Per quanto riguarda il prodotto Arduino uno è un' ottima piattaforma hardware programmabile su cui montare, testare, utilizzare i sensori più disparati, i sfruttando le potenzialità dei protocolli come One-wire. Tutto ciò che c'è da sapere lo su può apprendere dal sito ufficiale di Arduino"
2513,"An official device from the Arduino folks themselves, rather than a cheaper Chinese board. You do pay a premium but in doing so you're supporting the Arduino project."
2514,"Prodotto eccezionale e originale, di ottima manifattura.Rapporto qualità prezzo imbattibile e buona la qualità dell'imballaggio.L'oggetto è arrivato entro i tempi di consegna previsti ed è risultato perfetto (come da aspettative) dopo alcuni test preliminari."
2515,"Unless you feel like wasting your money, just bite the bullet and spend the extra $20 on a knock off with a kit.  All arduino blueprints are public domain, so identical knock offs are made by chinese companies for the cheap.  With these cheaper boards they can throw in more electrical components then you'll know what to do with.  With this arduino all you'll have is the board and regret for not buying a kit with useful parts.  If this is your first buy I'd get a kit with a cheaper board."
2516,Presentation of product is impeccable.
2517,Ottimo
2518,Arduino è una scheda elettronica il cui uso è limitato solo dalla fantasia unita ovviamente alla capacità tecnica di utilizzarlo.Ottimo prodotto!
2519,Un classico
2520,Great product easy to use
2521,I received the Ardunio right on time and works really good for the price. I now have one clone and one original and still want more.
2522,Delivered in perfect condition
2523,Très Bien
2524,"Seems to work ok but seriously think this is not the genuine article - it's a Chinese copy.The UNO logo and the rear of the PCB are not the same as a genuine UNO.There are videos on YouTube showing you how to identify if your board is genuine - and mine fails the test. Also it was delivered in a plain white box instead of a branded Arduino box - another indication that it is not the genuine article.The photograph in the product description IS of the genuine board - but this is not what you receive.Whilst it appears to work ok, I think the description should clearly state that this is a clone."
2525,"In the beginning, no driver was detected using Win 10, After update windows 10 the driver was detected"
2526,Works perfectly and does everything it needs to. Used this in a school project to make a fingerprint activated alarm for a bag and it turned out great. Easy to program and the code is easy to learn as well.
2527,"It seems to be worth getting a genuine one of these, until I bought this I was using a Sainsmart clone, and it was crashing on fast I/O operations."
2528,Lo que esperaba. OK.
2529,"auf Vorrat, damit ich keine langen Wartezeiten habe, wenn ich wieder ein Bastelprojekt habe.Das Board ist schnell in  Betrieb genommen. Ein Shield drauf und man kann ganz schnell eineApplikation verwirklichen. Die I/Os sind für normale Projekte ausreichend und wenn nicht, dannist schnell über I2C externe HW angebunden. Also ich liebe das Arduino-Konzept!"
2530,Excellent product
2531,L'acquisto più divertente e utile che abbia mai fatto!
2532,Vom Hobby Programmierer bis hin zu größeren Anlagen ist der kleine Arduino für jeden die richtige Wahl in meinen Augen. Niedriger Preis aber durch viele Module sehr gut erweiterbar. Von LEDs bis Bewässerungsanlage sind hier nur die eigenen Fähigkeiten die Grenzen.
2533,Kleiner schöner mini Bastelrechner ohne Beschädigungen angekommen.Leute wissen was man mit ihm alles machen kann.Dies ist mein erster Arduino und die automatisierte Steuerungen finde  eine klasse Lösung mit dem Produkt.
2534,"Bin schon vor einiger Zeit auf den Mikrocontroller Zug aufgesprungen.Der Arduino ist eine feste Konstante, mit günstigem Preis, super Community und hochwertiger Hardware.Der Preis ist höher als die China Klone, doch ich wollte die Erfinder unterstützen, nicht die chinesischen Kloner."
2535,Great priduct
2536,"La scheda, a mio parere personale, sembra originale al 100% e funziona perfettamente.Il cavo usb non è incluso nella confezione ma non è un grosso problema dato che è quello che si usa per collegare le stampanti al pc quindi non è difficile da trovare.Spedizione amazon rapida come sempre!"
2537,"Es war ein Geschenk für einen Informatik-Studenten, der gerne ""bastelt"" - er war zufriedenGeschenk für Informatiker/Programmierer/technisch-affiner Mensch/Schüler, der programmiert/programmieren lernen will"
2538,Habe vor Jahren das erste mal vom Arduino gehört und mich endlich dazu entschlossen auch mal einen zu kaufen.Wer sich bisschen mit Elektronik und PCs auskennt findet schnell ins Thema.Aktuell zeichne ich gerade Temperaturen im PC auf. Einfach klasse!Der nächste Arduino (Nano) ist schon bestellt.
2539,Bon service. Matériel bien emballé. Tout fonctionne bien.Merci
2540,great A+++
2541,Sempre compatibile e mai dato problemi rispetto alle imitazioni low-cos.
2542,good product fast ship
2543,"Buen producto llego en menor tiempo que el acordad, muy bien"
2544,"Acheter pour suivre un MOOC, je me suis fait une frayeur avec les commentaires qui annonçaient une contrefaçon :  il me semble pourtant que c'est belle et bien un Arduino UNO officiel. Il fonctionne parfaitement avec les outils standard."
2545,Acquistato per dei lavori al laboratorio di scuola. Prezzo più basso rispetto allo store. Ottimo prodotto.
2546,Awesome product works as expected. met my needs and Expectations
2547,"comprato per il progetto d'esame...sapevo già programmarlo tuttavia, grazie alle guide e agli esempi sul sito arduino è quasi impossibile non riuscirci...unica pecca del pacco è che comprende solamente la scheda arduino...il cavo lo devi comprare separatamente...per il resto è ottimo"
2548,"No entiendo tanta polémica diciendo algunos comentarios que es pirata, Yo tengo varios Arduinos piratas, y haciendo la comparación de las soldaduras y algunos componente ves la calidad de está placa. Está claro que es la original, y funciona perfectamente."
2549,Arrived as promised. Great Product.
2550,"Came right away as promised. But, for $27.99 I figured that the USB cable would come with it. Need this for a project and now have to go out and purchase cable. A bit disappointed."
2551,Dank des ATmega in DIL-Form lässt sich dieses Bord auch gut als Programmer nutzen. Entfernt man den ATmega lassen sich die Arduino Minis anstelle dessen gut mit Sketsches beladen. Die Verarbeitung ist exzellent.
2552,"articolo arrivato entro la data prevista, pacco protetto, scheda perfettamente funzionante e soprattutto è originale al 100%, ne ho usate tante sia originali e non e questa posso assicurare che lo è. Nel pacco previsti anche adesivi e un po di colla (credo) per attaccarlo da qualche parte. in definitiva prodotto OTTIMO"
2553,"Die Beschriftung löst sich beim Handling sehr schnell ab, da müsste man nachbessern, ansonsten ist das Ding multifunktional und super einzusetzen."
2554,Sehr guter Microcontroller. Vor allem ist dieser ein original Arduino UNO.
2555,It was a one time project and it was the right one.
2556,Rápido y sin problema
2557,"Exactly as Described, wonderful product!"
2558,Everything was as expected.
2559,Nice starter board
2560,"Quality board, works great"
2561,"The board was different then shown on the picture (at the time). The golden chip, certifying it's Arduino brand, was absent."
2562,Anyone who wants to make physical programming a hobby should get this microcontroller.
2563,Very good! Much more reliable than a few third-party ones.
2564,good deal
2565,Ottimo imballaggio e ottime funzionalità. Consiglio a tutti coloro che necessitano di un arduino per passioner o bisogno.Insieme all'arduino troviamo anche un manuale perfetto
2566,LLegó a tiempo y hasta el momento ha funcionado correctamente.
2567,Absolutely terrible. Became sentient in less than a week.
2568,Works perfectly - and if your worried about getting a clone - this is an official arduino. Something you'll need is an A to B USB cable (the kind that printers use) to get started.
2569,Macht Spaß damit kleine Projekte zu realisieren.
2570,"Though there are cheap variants out there, the best bet for sure fire compatibility and quality are the original Arduino products. Good purchase"
2571,買って二ヶ月たたないのにプログラムを書き込めなくなった。UNO互換、中国製の方が全然安くていいい。返品できずに困っている。買ってはいけない。
2572,Fantastic
2573,Ottimo prodotto
2574,nothing like the real thing
2575,one of the I/O parts is crooked so I'm afraid of putting a shield on it and have it be messed up.
2576,"Direkt loslegen können mit Programmieren und Realisieren eigener Projekte. Im Internet wird man zudem ""totgeschmissen"" mit kostenlosen Tipps, Hilfen und Projekten zum nachbauen. Zum lernen sehr gut, nutzte ich es neben dem Studium (ET) um etwas ""Praxiserfahrung"" zu sammeln und mal praktisch ""rumzuspielen"" :-)"
2577,Works straight away!  Easy to use - perfect for starters.
2578,"Works perfectly, authentic, and shipped perfectly on time!"
2579,Alles in Ordnung
2580,A good board
2581,Alles Perfekt gute Qualität und funktioniert alles einwandfrei. Immer nur weiter zu empfehlen. Es ist auch für Anfänger gut die mit Programmierung anfangen wollen.
2582,"Appena arrivato lo collego al pc portatile Win 10 64 bit all'inizio tutto ok mi metto a programmarlo e funziona tutto regolarmente, lo scollego metto via in attesa del nuovo progetto, automazione tapparelle, faccio il programma tutto ok lo collego solita porta solito pc nessuna modifica, non so perché non lo vede più nulla,disinstallo reinstallo cambio porta ma nulla, provo anche con Ubuntu nulla non va più mi dispiace non è per il valore ma credevo fosse un prodotto più affidabile..."
2583,"Acquistato per provare vari esperimenti in casa, ha rispettato le mie aspettative.Le saldature sono fatte bene e i componenti originali."
2584,Works like itshould
2585,Good one. Works perfectly
2586,"Esta bien, un Arduino original, servicio bien, funcionamiento bien pues eso un arduino.Un saludo Francisco."
2587,Recipient was pleased.
2588,great board! if it isnt a genuine arduino then I dont care because it works just as well or better
2589,"Arrived as advertised, my first foray into the Arduino world"
2590,Product ok
2591,Carte Arduino de très bonne qualité reçu rapidement ce qui est bine pour monter un projet urgent. Le câble n’est pas fourni avec pensez à vous en fournir un
2592,"excellent service, as advertised"
2593,Tutto ok regalato a mio figlio x scuola ha detto che va bene.
2594,"Prima volta che compro questo microcontrollore dopo averne sentito parlare tante volte. Una sola parola , eccezionale. Potrete fare di tutto e divertirvi programmando e costruire addirittura  anche un vostro robot personale ;).Compratelo! Non ve ne' pentirete!"
2595,"Very tidy little unit, with  CNC Shield and stepper driver assembly still very compact, ideal form my CNC GRBL project."
2596,"Good product, fast delivery"
2597,Bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Original Arduino
2598,"Super,danke"
2599,Operates fine and has a plastic frame around the sides and bottom.
2600,純正品。おまけにシールも入っている。（笑）問題なく動作しています。
2601,Works as describedI'm using it to drive ws2812b led strips behind my computer monitors
2602,"Purtroppo l'ho dovuto ordinare 2 volte perché ultimamente i geni del reparto spedizioni/imballaggio è un pezzo che non mettono nemmeno un minimo di imballaggio, NEMMENO per prodotti delicati come questo.Risultato: aveva tutte le file di pin piegate.Prodotto di per sè ottimo"
2603,Reconnu immédiatement sur Mac os catalina.Reste plus qu'à coder.
2604,"Das Produkt ist von arduino.org, ein Hersteller von Arduino Platinen also NICHT vom eigentlichen unterstützenswerten Hersteller der Arduino Software, arduino.cc. Deswegen sagt die Arduino Software auch, dass dieser Uno nicht original ist. Wollte durch den Kauf die eigentlichen Erfinder und Entwickler unterstützen, wenn ich nur ein Board gewollt hätte, wäre es deutlich billiger gegangen.NACHTRAG: die originalen Arduinos heißen jetzt (außerhalb der USA) Genuino"
2605,Conforme à la description. Fonctionne parfaitement.
2606,Gran producto! Funciona muy bien
2607,"J’ai acheté cette carte pour l’utiliser avec les élèves, c’est nickel et pas chère."
2608,"Works very well, will buy again"
2609,"Esattamente l'originale, mi sta servendo fedelmente dal primo giorno (e si che l'ho pure maltrattato). Va comprato almeno uno, per supportare il progetto e per avere in mano l'originale, come detto."
2610,I'm loving the Arduino!
2611,--
2612,"Prodotto Arduino originale consegnato dentro l'apposita scatolina con bolli di garanzia. All'interno viene pure inserita una comoda piastrina di fissaggio che può risultare molto utile. Che dire, un prodotto eccellente !"
2613,Great open source library!
2614,Leider kein Kabel.
2615,"Exactly what it says on the tin, can't recommend enough. It is so streamlined compared to RPi it just makes so many things much easier!"
2616,"Works fine, though Matlab didn't recognize the arduino as an Original Arduino."
2617,"Works just fine, just don't jumper the wrong I/O!"
2618,Quality
2619,"Such a great piece of kit, worth the extra in my view to makes sure you have at least 1 original in the house."
2620,"Arrivato in anticipo, ottime condizioni.... Gran bell' acquisto! Il top per imparare le basi della programmazione"
2621,As expected! :-)
2622,Ottimo x quel prezzo.Arriva subito ma senza alcuna istruzione.Poi basta andare su internet e trovi di tutto inclusi vari esempi di programma.Nel complesso very OK!
2623,Nonostante spedita dall'estero la consegna è stata davvero rapida. La scheda funziona perfettamente. Insieme alla scheda ho trovato anche una basetta in plexiglass per agganciarla e non rovinarla mentre la uso.
2624,"trattasi di un arduino originale, viene fornito con 4 stick da utilizzare come piedini....per il resto che dire? Arduino e' Arduino, lo si puo' utilizzare per mille progetti diversi e non vi deludera' mai...."
2625,Posso solo aggiungermi alla numerosa lista di estimatori di Arduino. Con mia gradita sorpresa la scheda era inserita in una basetta di plastica
2626,Interessantissimo.
2627,Excellent product used in a robot car
2628,Parfair
2629,"The arduino was good but there were a few things that were wrong with my order. The processor was completely different than what was advertised in the picture. It has a Surface Mounted (SMD) version of the ATMEGA328P, not the Plated Through Hole (PTH) style one shown in the picture. Also, mine had some metal shaving in one of the grounding pins which made that unusable."
2630,produit reçu rapidement mais sans cable usb ni d'alimentation.
2631,"Fantastic way to combine my favourite hobbies, making things & programming!Easy to develop for if you know any C++ based languages."
2632,Works grea
2633,Es ist eben genauso wie ich es bestellt habe. Es gibt nichts zu beanstanden. Solide verbaut. Wirkt gut und professionell.
2634,Ottimi per iniziare a programmare. Robusto e consigliato anche per. Persone non esperte
2635,Loving this thing and learning more every day
2636,Come ho scritto nell'oggetto... basta avere un minimo di conoscenze e competenze nel campo dell'elettronica e arduino è il vostro compagno per far tutto.Probabilmente si trovano dei cloni a più basso costo però ho preferito andare sul sicuro.
2637,Diese Artikel ist sehr schön. Alle Bauelemente sind stark angebaut. Die Qualität ist sehr hoch. Preis ist aber nicht günstig.
2638,初めてのAruduino学習用に購入しました。他店で購入した方が安かったのですがスイッチサイエンスさんが信頼出来そうだったのでこちらで購入しました。２ヶ月ぐらい使用したところでUSBから認識しなくなりました。こちらの商品には「永久保証」の商品説明は無く、永久保証のシールが貼られた箱も捨ててしまいましたが、下記URLで永久保証の説明が有りましたので連絡したところアマゾンの購入履歴で確認出来るとの事で修理受付して頂けました。[・・・]僅かな価格差で安い店舗から購入するより、永久保証で支援して頂けるスイッチサイエンス様に感謝です。でも、念のため箱は大切に保管しておきましょう。
2639,Todo bien la entrega y el producto.
2640,Even a 70 year old such as me can get to grips with this!
2641,"ottimo prodotto, originale, nella scatola originale. consegna veloce e puntuale.Attenzione non c'è il cavo usb A a B, quindi procuratevelo."
2642,"Bin Anfänger, im Internet gibst da genug Beispiele für michund das ist der Rest für die 18 zur Bewertung geforderten Wörter bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla"
2643,Soddisfatto del prodotto e arrivato in tempi previsti e in ottime condizioni.
2644,The standard for prototyping.
2645,"Il prodotto non è per me, ma posso dire che si presenta nella sua confezione originale ed è arrivato prima del termine previsto."
2646,Es lo que buscaba
2647,No issues. Great Service.
2648,Je recommande
2649,"Scheda perfettamente conforme alle specifiche dettate, funzionante e con scatola inclusa. Devo dire che sono molto ma molto soddisfatto dell’acquisto."
2650,"Il prodotto è arrivato DALLA GERMANIA in tempi devo dire più che decenti. L'imballaggio era inesistente, praticamente c'era la scatola originale dell'arduino con i vari fogli e adesivi buttati dentro la busta delle poste con protezione minima"
2651,Arduino non delude mai. Top del top per gli amatori. Prezzo poi nemmeno tanto più alto degli altri prodotti paralleli .
2652,"No estoy seguro si es copia o no... parece que no. Desde luego el funcionamiento es correcto, y el vendedor atento y comunicativo. Todo correcto."
2653,Prodotto ampiamente noto
2654,Ottimo prodotto
2655,"I have spend countless hours trying to get this to work but get the message :  problem. uploading the board. Very disappointing,consideringyour otherwise excellent service.I have ordered a second board which is arriving Friday, If that works I will be returning the first board if not I will return both"
2656,L'Arduino c'e' ed e' funzionante. Peccato che manchino cavo di alimentazione e USB
2657,Genuine Arduino
2658,"funziona perfettamente. spedizione eccellente. non mi è piaciuta la busta di cartone che conteneva la scatolina originale dell'arduino. è arrivata un po' schiacciata. consiglio di sostituire la ""busta"" con un parallelepipedo di cartone."
2659,"Sieht nach echtem Uno aus, funktioniert auch so. Und das USB-Kabel funktioniert auch. Der Preis ist gut. Das Gerät kommt per Einschreiben."
2660,This is a counterfeit Arduino. Don't buy it. If you have already bought it confirm that its original by following the steps onhttps://www.arduino.cc/en/Products/CounterfeitThe one I received was not in a box and it was made in China while the Amazon claims that it is Authentic Made In Italy Arduino Uno R3 Board. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This was not at all expected from Amazon.
2661,Que decir del Uno... ideal. Programo hace mucho para Arduino y me encanta esta placa. Sencilla y robusta. Vale para casi todo. Muy recomendable.
2662,Fantastic product with amazing community support and projects.
2663,Genuine article - what's not to like
2664,Original board. Not a clone. Very happy
2665,Arrivo puntuale Usato per la scuola funziona.
2666,"Leider wird dieses Produkt garnicht angeboten von e-joker.de. Stattdessen erhält man ein Arduino TinkerKit Sensor modul. Nach Absprache mit ejoker.de kann ich es zum Glück kostenfrei zurück schicken. Aber trotzdem blöde, wenn man auf den gewünschten Artikel wartet und etwas anderes erhält."
2667,Genuine Ardingly r3
2668,Come da aspettative.
2669,Preciosa pieza de ingeniería electrónica. Fácil de usar en prototipos. Lo recomiendo a los padres de familia para trabajar con sus hijos y que amen el hacer cosas con sus propias manos.
2670,"Les doy 5 estrellas porque el producto llegó en buenas condiciones y en el tiempo pactado.Además del producto que compré recibí un plus y eso me gustó aun más!!!Mantengan esta calidad de servicio y sigan mejorando siempre, es algo que se agradece significativamente.Felicidades"
2671,Producto original.
2672,Excellent seller.  Excellent item.
2673,"Molto utile per imparare ed avvicinarsi al mondo dell'elettronica e a quello della programmazione. Strumento ideale per studenti di ingegneria ma anche appassionati. Attenti però a non confonderlo per un dispositivo adatto all'uso industriale, perchè quello (IMHO) non è il suo scopo.Personalmente mi ha permesso di imparare un sacco di cose molto utili."
2674,Item as described. Thanks 😀
2675,Nessun commento. E' Arduino! Nessun problema nella spedizione e nessun problema nella scheda. Consigliata a tutti coloro che vogliono cimentarsi nel mondo della programmazione.
2676,Buino
2677,Ras
2678,"Ottimo prodotto ed eccellente spedizione con Amazon Prime! non contiene il cavo usb. Originale arduino come si può vedere dal retro in ""punti critici"" come la mappa dell italia"
2679,"Ordinato la Domenica il lunedi' gia' in consegna, imballo perfetto, ora sta funzionando correttamente, E' andato a sostituire una scheda arduino non originale utilizzata per le prove."
2680,Works perfect!
2681,J'ai choisi cette carte car elle est parfaite pour mon développement.Une carte que je peux facilement intégrer au montage.Excellente.
2682,"divertentissimo ci si fanno mille progetti divertenti , è originale consiglio di acquistare uno starter kit sempliceper poi acquistare i pezzi che interessano a parte"
2683,"Diversamente da quanto detto nelle altre recensioni, a me è arrivato l'originale. è completo di scatola con istruzioni, adesivi e piedini in gomma."
2684,Conforme à la description
2685,"Arduino, poco da dire, originale Made in Italy, e questo è una garanzia, acquistato per sostuirne altri, utilizzati in altri progetti. Cinque stelle!"
2686,No viene con cable USB...y el empaquetado es insuficiente..he tenido que devolver el mío ya que vino pisoteado y con las patillas.fuera del.sobre. lamentable. Eso sí llegó muy rápido.
2687,works great
2688,Nice little board
2689,No cage driver de Puerto y no comunica con ordenador.La devolví.
2690,Cumple con las expectativas
2691,"Tutto come mi aspettavo, ricevuta la versione di Arduino.org anziché Arduino.cc. Buon imballaggio e spedizione rapida. Adesso potrò finalmente iniziare i miei progetti dell'Internet of Things."
2692,"Prodotto davvero ben fatto. Sul Web si trova di tutto per imparare a programmare: video, siti... Consigliato ad esperti e Principianti."
2693,Arrivato perfettamente in tempo.confezione Ok.Testato funziona.si tratta di un microcontrollore si tratta di un microcontrollore si tratta di un microcontrollore
2694,un prodotto favoloso ad un prezzo ragionevole ideale per chi vuole cominciare ad immergersi nel mondo di arduino consigliata a tutti
2695,"prodotto perfetto. Se si è in grado di programmare, si può creare davvero di tutto, dai robot alla casa smart. Super consigliato"
2696,Good quality.
2697,"Fake?... After looking on the official site, these boards are looking more like a counterfeit. So many differences between this board and the genuine one. I became suspicious when this board did not come with the thank you note and stickers."
2698,Ottima scheda per iniziare a creare dei piccoli o grandi progetti per automatizzare la casa.Originale se presa da CampuStore
2699,Prodotto originale della Arduino.orgSarebbe stato comodo acquistare uno dei tanti cloni ma bisogna sostenere questo bellissimo progetto e anche l'industria manifatturiera ITALIANA.Grazie
2700,Excellent product and delivery
2701,"Very disappointedPlugged in my 12 volt adapter and it fried the power regulator immediately.  Since I was troubleshooting an issue with my lcd display I assumed that was the cause,  but after reading all the reviews identifying this as a fake I'm not to sure. Only bright side is that it didn't cost a lot,  but to represent this Chinese knock off as genuine is unethical."
2702,ottimo prodotto per chi vuole imparare a programmare un microcontroller ed utilizzarlo per applicazioni di vario genere ( io per esempio lo vorrei utilizzare per generare l'effetto onda in un acquario marino pilotando due pompe di movimento alternativamente).
2703,"Già comprato in precedenza, è davvero un articolo fantastico. se vi intendete di elettronica fa davvero al caso vostro! ;)"
2704,"The board I received has a vendor Id of 2A03 (Arduino.org)- a genuine Arduino should be 2341 (Arduino.cc). The latest Arduino IDE will support it, but if you want to connect to Android - many Apps will not recognise it."
2705,"Ne ho comprati 2 per il mio drone e durante il funziomamento è caduto entrambe le volte spegnendosi di improvviso, oltretutto arduino non si è più ricollegato all'IDE e la spia Load rimane accesa segno di difetto. Lo sconsiglio vivamente, penso che sia anche una copia ben fatta. Prima ne avevo preso uno originale di colore blu e il drone funzionava perfettamente."
2706,after only about 1 month of usage.
2707,Excellent!!
2708,It works!
2709,Fantastic little device.
2710,"no deberían salir esas imagenes ni decir que es de la marca arduino si es una copia, de buena calidad pero una copia"
2711,Le produit que j’ai recu n’est pas un arduino originale comme montre’ dans la photo mais il s’agit d’un faux. En plus il ne marche deja plus apres la premiere utilisation.
2712,"This product is faulty! The 2.1 mm jack won't give me reliable power!  It hasn't even been 30 days and this ""brand name"" super pricy board absolutely sucks. I want my money back!!!!"
2713,"Like many others here, the board I received was a counterfeit. I recommend buying directly instead."
2714,I led sulla scheda non si illuminano più :(
2715,Il prodotto è ottimo e funziona correttamentePurtroppo manca Il cavo di Alimentazione che è indispensabile per il suo funzionamento.
2716,"prodotto FASULLO NON FUNZIONA E NESSUNO ME LO CAMBIA,CHE FREGATURA,DIFETTOSO,E NO IMPORTA A NESSUNOLO SCONSIGLIO FORTEMENTE,POSSIBILE CHE SIA COSI COMPLICATO DARE UN PRODOTTO CHE FUNZIONA"
2717,"La scheda a Microcontrollore programmabile più facile da utilizzare, ci si puo' fare di tutto, da un allarme casalingo ad un termostato remoto...."
2718,Non è presente il cavo usb
2719,"Einfach super, ein original halt eben!"
2720,Liked size and capability of nano to assist in my hobby
2721,Es el original por tanto la calidad es muy buena
2722,"Most of the non-Arduino versions of this product requires you to locate, download and install the CH340 driver. Instead, the Arduino version uses the FT232 driver. Everything is pre-installed and ready to use, right out of the box. I had it up and running in minutes. In fact, in a networking project I'm playing with, it outperformed my other microcontrolers, including a couple of larger Arduinos. If I can find the time, i will deal with the clones and their CH340 driver."
2723,I tried using a clone but it wouldn't connect to my computer so I had to use this. I wasn't excited to pay extra for the same thing but what are you gonna do.
2724,Cadeau
2725,D4 & D5 connections were soldered together during assembly process at manufacturer. Was able to de-solder & separate the joints but still an unfortunate pain. I expected better since this wasn't a knockoff.
2726,"There is a bit of a learning curve to program it, but once you figure it out (or borrow code someone else has made and left online for use) it works great. I personally used mine as a controller for a NeoPixel ring I have, and am able to control every aspect of it through the Arduino."
2727,Work great and no serial communication problem with longer usb cable compare too the cheaper one. The cheaper one work ok with short usb cable.
2728,"I only gave this a 4 out of 5 rating since the Nano board did not come with a cable, and it uses a special USB cable, not a micro USB.......so if you order one of these, make sure you get the correct cable to power it and be able to download your software to it."

2739,"This little Nano board works great.  Did not have to do anything special in plugging it it.  I would buy again, if I ever needed a 2nd one."
2740,"Tuve que instalar los controladores ftdi ft232 para que el Arduino nano funcionara, la IDE detecta la placa pero la marca como desconocida; el detalle de que la instalación del ide no tenga los controladores resulta extrano, las imagenes mostradas en la publicación no corresponden al componente que recibí, quizá es una versión más antigua, la serigrafía no es la misma."
2741,It works. I purchased a non-genuine Nano (3-pack) and none of them worked. The genuine Arduino Nano worked once I found the driver (just a little challenging.)
2742,"I currently have two of these, and for $20 a piece I’m pretty disappointed. After purchasing the original Arduino branded ones, I went and purchased some off branded Nanos from Elegoo. At this point, I would say I prefer my knockoff Nanos as opposed to the branded ones. I have always had some issue when using these, and overall the knockoffs seem to outperform the original, such as a considerable faster upload speed and ability to register as a device as soon as I plug it into my computer (I always have to manually choose which port to use when using the original). It’s pretty disappointing considering the price disparity as well. Normally, I would give the benefit of doubt to the brand name and call it a dud, but I have two of them. Needless to say, I won’t be purchasing another Nano from Arduino. The only reason I’m giving it three stars is because without them, we wouldn’t have the Nano in the first place, and I respect them for open sourcing their products."
2743,Used in a spot welder project. Just gotta roll up the sleeves and take the coding plunge.
2744,"Unless what you're working on is very quality sensitive or requires very specific sizing, I would recommend a ""clone"" or ""knockoff"" nano instead. They have the same feature set but you can often get them at a much better price -- I personally I found 3 clones for less than the price of this single ""real"" nano.However, I will say I have no issues with this particular nano and I would recommend buying one if you're quality sensitive or want to support Arduino platform directly."
2745,"i have been using Nano clones for a while, and i thought it would be about time to get a genuine Nano in-house.  the original doesn't behave exactly like the clone, or maybe the clones don't behave exactly the same as the genuine Nano.  of course, the Arduino guys change things every once in a while, and the latest V3 Nano's are not quite the same as the older V3 Nano's.  that contributes to the slight differences in behavior.  in any case, the genuine Nano works fine, and i'm glad i have one around for sanity checks."
2746,"You pay at least 2x the price for a real Arduino vs. a Chinese knock-off, however if you want quality parts and assembly, do with the real thing.  Make sure you buy from a reputable seller, as some sell fakes. Compare what you get to photos from the Arduino website... fakes will usually not have the correct box, paperwork, and markings on the circuit board."
2747,Me ha gustado el acabado. Perfecto para el aprendizaje y pruebas de circuitos.
2748,"Unlike cloned brand Nano boards, this Arduino branded board won't trip you up or fail you. I've found that using no-name generic devices, boards, sensors, etc in my electronics hobby only adds frustration, lessening the time I really enjoy myself."
2749,Pretty sure D4 and D5 should not be soldered together. Will have to return and order another one.
2750,"I knew it was small, but its actually even smaller than i thought. It has been a joy to use and to have an official arduino instead of a copycat. No difference in functionality but supporting those who made this great product possible, it means a lot!"
2751,It’s working with the small projects I’m doing. I wish it came with a cable
2752,"What's not to like?  It's a much faster processor with 50% more program space, 200% more RAM, multiple UARTs, and in a Nano v3 pin-compatible form-factor.  Less than $10/ea in a 3-pack.  I only wish I'd found it earlier."
2753,This is a genuine Arduino Nano (unlike some other knock offs you can find for half the price and with quadruple of the headache). It works great and as expected out of the box.
2754,Bought two and within my first week had a TFT 240p LCD displaying sensor outputs. Has been a great learning experience and worth spending the extra to support the team. In addition Arduinos new IDE should make things 2X better.
2755,"You pay a whole lot more for a genuine argue we know, but if you’re using a Chinese knock off on a CNC machine, the first piece of material you screw up by using that Chinese knock off will cost more than a genuine argentino so suck it up and buy it now before you’re cussing at the machine later"
2756,This micro-processor is tough.  Being new to Arduino projects I am sure I was harder on this than usual.  It is working great for a Digital Compass OTA antenna tuning project.
2757,As my Arduino projects get more complex the Nano plus a larger breadboard helps me keep the wiring a lot cleaner. Works just like my Uno.
2758,"No viene con cable, y según los comentarios, venía con él."
2759,Worked as expected.  Just didn’t come with a power cable.  Had to run around for a store that sold it.
2760,Hooked it to an ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer to modify sketch - it works great for small projects.  Had output within minutes.  Be aware it requires a mini-B USB cable that isn't included.
2761,I like it but with my great fingers it can be tough to work with...I need more of them
2762,"I like to use actual Arduino hardware (not a knockoff), and this seller supplied it accurately and quickly."
2763,"Worked fine for a day, then it overheated and the port failed."
2764,"E’ il nano originale con ATmega328p, compatibile con tutto il software e le immense librerie esistenti. Consigliatissimo come primo Arduino. Niente a che vedere con i cloni cinesi, qualità italiana e design anche bello esteticamente!!"
2765,Original y de calidad
2766,Uses same arduino IDE as my UNO and MEGA.  Love the compact size.
2767,"Done with the clones, genuine arduino is the way to go."
2768,"Arduino originale, ma per l'utilizzo con il programma arduino 1.8.12 su windows 10 necessita il download dei driver FTDI e nello specifico la versione 2.12.26"
2769,My favorite Arduino board.
2770,A lot easier to get set up than the cheaper stm32 counterparts. Pins are already attached so it's reading to go out of the box. Only gripe is the use of the older mini-b standard.
2771,"Classic Arduino, works great!"
2772,"Bhe che dire, Arduino Nano originale, con un packaging impeccabile, con pin già saldati, adesivi inclusi, a differenza di 2 anni funziona ancora benissimo, forse il prezzo è un po' alto ma ha una qualità eccellente"
2773,
2774,The real thing from Arduino. Works flawlessly.
2775,Gli Arduino genuini sono di qualità ottima!
2776,Genuine . Bootloader is correct for this board
2777,Great product
2778,Does what it's supposed to do.
2779,"The only reason I didn't rate this as ""easy to use"", is because it is an Arduino....It takes some learning."
2780,solid product
2781,Useful little module for including in embedded projects.
2782,All it’s ok
2783,Würde das Produkt bei Bedarf wieder bestellen.
2784,:3
2785,I had to install drivers to get the nano to work
2786,Para ser el producto original ya podría incluir un cable de conexión... Aún no puedo probarlo porque tengo que comprar el cable adicional.
2787,"The nano seems to work OK, however it arrived used in a broken box."
2788,ottimo prodotto e servizio
2789,Poco más hay que decir; es la arduino original. Funcionamiento perfecto.
2790,Superbe comme toujours avec Arduino - à utiliser sur connecteur pour en faire une carte de test.
2791,Your buying this because you know what it is used for.
2792,Used it to create a knobster for Flight simming
2793,It never worked.  It arrived on time so one star.  Is anything worst than getting something that never even worked?  Not in my opinion.  You should pass.
2794,"Ordered a nano Arduino, received Arduino Uno."
2795,This is a genuine Arduino and very well priced.
2796,difícil de usar. Fraca compatibilidade.
2797,"Decided to try the 'real' Arduino nano to avoid problem with drivers and uploading sketches. Boy, was I mistaken. Followed the suggestions in the FAQ's and reviews.  Downloaded the new drivers and installed them to no avail. Tried the suggestions and experimented for about 3 hours and then gave up and went back to the Elegoo clones.  I least I can make those work."
2798,"Ich habe den Bewertungen wegen der ""Fakes"" nicht unbedingt Glauben schenken wollen und habe trotzdem bestellt. Das Produkt sieht sehr ""echt"" aus, es ist auch ein Aufkleber dabei und auf dem Chip steht EFTDI.Ich habe es mit zwei verschiedenen Mini-USB-Kabeln getestet und auf zwei verschiedenen Betriebssystemen (Catalina und Win 10). Beim Anschließen leuchtet aber nix und es kommt auch kein Sound in Windows oder so, das Ding wird einfach nicht erkannt. Ich vermute, dass es kaputt angekommen ist. Allerdings meine ich, dass die ""Originale"" vor dem Versenden getestet werden (inkl. eines selbst-Test-Programms?).Ich habe nun einen Neuen bestellt, auf der offiziellen Seite gibt es eine Liste mit offiziellen Resellern in DE, vielleicht habe ich diesmal mehr Glück. Aber mein Projekt verzögert sich um ein paar Tage. Schade."
2799,Produit original
2800,"The package was already open and the seal on it was broken although the status of the item was supposed to be ""new""."
2801,Embalaje aplstado y sin cable de conexión.
2802,I had an interactive painting that I programmed that ceased working because the chip got bricked by the driver developer. This is GARBAGE. I am out 20$ because of what? Bad software practices among within the company? I wouldn't recommend this product or this company for selling fake chips to anyone.
2803,CAME BENT THE BOX WAS DESTROYED AND BROKEN!
2804,I ordered this needing an arduino nano however when I received it I got a arduino nano every which uses a different processor. Need to update the description.
2805,"Installed the Arduino IDE + included USB Drivers. Inside the Arduino IDE ""Port"" was grayed out. In the device manager it listed the Nano under ""Other Devices"" as FT232R USB UART with no driver. Tried uninstalled, reinstalling, restarting, different cables, nothing worked. After searching around I installed some drivers on ftdichip.com and it works."
2806,Ottimo è già la terza volta che ne riprendo uno
2807,Shows up in device manager on Windows 10 as FT232R USB UART with no driver. Have the latest version of the arduino ide downloaded and running. Cannot download a driver for this product. Has factory tested blink function running but cannot upload to it since it is not recognized.
2808,Acabado impecable
2809,"Packaging is poorly designed, contacts bent, don't even want to try it, no time to waste on this."
2810,Ottimo
2811,Ottimo
2812,Never had any issues with Uno's but the first Nano came DOA.
2813,"He hecho ya dos proyectos con él, funciona de maravilla. El packaging demuestra que es totalmente original, no un clon falso."
2814,Excelente
2815,Snabb leverans och produkten är enligt specifikation.
2816,"Arrivato in perfetto orario, ben imballato... bellissimo oggetto - Arduino Genuino è una garanzia!"
2817,"Bought this to make art posts in Splatoon 3.  Works well, no issues with the right software"
2818,It's ok.
2819,bought this and a Leonardo downloaded the software updated the drivers manually cause windows tries to load a generic USB driver on them and couldn't get either to work for a few days. I went to the forums seems to be a common issue with some boards I found out it was my cpu cooler software causing the issue but seems like it is hit or miss but now that I have it working they do what I want them to and more very nice quality.

2827,"Ich liebte dieses kleine Gerät. Mein Arbeits-PC lässt mich seine Energiespareinstellungen und Einstellungen für die automatische Sperre nicht ändern. Wenn ich also meinen Desktop verwende, um etwas zu erledigen, und immer noch merke, dass ich E-Mails empfangen kann, habe ich im Internet einen Code gefunden, der dies empfiehlt Kaufen Sie dies und codieren Sie es, um die Maus in zufälligen Intervallen in eine zufällige Richtung zu bewegen. Es funktionierte so gut, dass selbst wenn ich eine Verbindung zu meinem iPad herstellte, es seinen Cursor bewegte. Kann es nur empfehlen :) Ich habe auch einen Fall 3d gedruckt, damit es bei seiner Tragbarkeit hilft."
2828,"Der neue Flugsimulator hat mich dazu gebracht, endlich eigene Panels für ein kleines Homecockpit zu bauen. Die bekannten Panels von Saitek sind doch sehr eingeschränkt für die – in meinem Fall – C208b nutzbar.Auf YouTube gibt es super Anleitungen, wie man ohne große Programmierkenntnisse mit einem Arduino so etwas realisieren kann. Ich wollte nur einfache Kippschalter (ON/OFF) und LEDs verbauen. Keine Potis oder Sensoren. Habe mir daraufhin ein Set aus drei Pro Micro Boards für ca. 15€ gekauft. Keines der drei Boards war voll funktionsfähig. Manche Pins wurden nicht erkannt, USB Kabel hielt nicht fest, usw.Daraufhin habe ich diesen Arduino Micro gekauft und dieser tut exakt, was er soll. Er wird direkt erkannt und es funktionieren alle Pins. Weiterhin sind die Headers bereits angelötet. Die anderen verbauten Komponenten machen auch einen wesentlich wertigeren Eindruck. Er ist nur ein klein wenig länger, aber die Größe war in meinem Fall kein Thema. Da die Header nur verlötet sind, lassen sich diese auch leicht entfernen. Sofern man über einen Lötkolben verfügt, was aber vermutlich der Fall ist.Wie sich das Board bei anspruchsvolleren Aufgaben schlägt kann ich nicht sagen. Die Beispielprogramme liefen darauf jedoch einwandfrei."
2829,"Great little controller, plenty of analog inputs.Runs short on memory quick though - most of these controllers don't even list memory - the ones that have a lot of memory are all sold out or going for double their worth."
2830,"Returned the first board I bought after an evening of swapping out computers, Arduino IDE settings, usb cables (I have used all of these cables for connecting devices in the past), and trying loopback tests. Could not get my computer to detect the device at all. Returned the board and ordered two more to make sure.New boards arrived and I had the same problem with both. Device Manager would not detect them, arduino IDE could not see them after several days of trying.Finally, I dug through every corner to find one more usb cable just to try, and it worked! I don't remember boards being so picky about the quality of the USB cable they use, but be warned about that! I recommend having another arduino board (Uno, Nano, Every, etc.) on hand if you run into connection issues to help avoid pitfalls like I ran into."
2831,My goal was to make my Logitech switch box usable since support for it is otherwise limited.  I removed all the internal switch box wiring and electronics and wired in the Micro using pins D0-A3 (with two spare!)Works great - now I can actually use the switch box.
2832,"Es ist schön und gut ""kompatible"", billige Boards zu kaufen, aber zumindest ein originales Arduino zu haben macht IMMER Sinn. Dann kann man wirklich gegenprüfen ob man alles richtig programmiert hat und weiß: Wenn es hier läuft, aber auf dem Billig-Board nicht, dann weiß man es liegt nicht am Sketch :-)"
2833,volevo avvicinarmi ad Arduino per alcuni piccolo progetti. Ho scelto il Micro così da usarlo comodamente sulla breadboard o installarlo con gli zoccolini sulla mille fori.Molto soddisfatto.
2834,"Fine hardware, well packaged, works well."
2835,"This is exactly what you are expecting for this kind of material! Worth the price!There is not much to say, the shipping was good, the quality is ok and the material also ok."
2836,"Arduino! What can I say? I love you! These may be little but, they are super powerful and easy to use. I picked micro for the native usb capabilities. It’s my new favorite Arduino board."
2837,"Great for my flight Yoke build. Just get it, why are you reading reviews? If it doesn't work for your project, you'll surely find other uses for it."
2838,"Great product what can I say, has so many uses! I used it to make a fighting stick for the GameCube/Switch to play smash ultimate. It works wonders!"
2839,"Bueno, aunque es el original, recomiendo más la compra de otros que son mas pequeños, más baratos y más potentes, en mi caso corte los pines cosa que me hubiese gustado que no tuviese, y no lo devuelvo por que le he cortado los pines, pero no estoy contento con el aunque así por lo menos he colaborado con arduino que se merece una ayuda por el hardware libre que han dado"
2840,"This is probably the easiest device of its type I've ever used, such a great library of code samples make it a doddle to cut and paste code to get this to do complex stuff quickly."
2841,"Received genuine parts, worked out of the box, came quickly, couldn't ask for more."
2842,Good product for the value
2843,"Es como la versión Leonardo pero más compacto. Compré un pack de una marca de terceros pero no es lo mismo, además viene soldado"
2844,Nice small form factor.
2845,手軽で簡単にIoTを体験することができる、とても楽しい！写真はARDUINOに土壌湿度センサーを取り付けたもの。ちゃんとアナログ入力を受け付けてくれ、usb経由でパソコンへの出力もできました。子供の工作にもとても良いと思います！
2846,"Matériel conforme, fonctionne trés bien."
2847,"Che dire: Arduino. Arrivato nei tempi, qualità Arduino, funzionato subito come tutte le altre schede della serie."
2848,as expected
2849,デバイスを生かす。ブレッドボード上1枚で完了させたかったのでこれを選んだ。UNOでは3.3Vのデバイスを動かすための降圧チップが必要だったりとか何かと面倒。(3.3Vの電源はあるものの面倒だった)お陰で簡易サーモグラフィーを作ることが出来て満足です。UNOいらないかな。
2850,Conforme alla descrizione riportata sul prodotto
2851,"Usato come joystick funziona molto bene.....Consigliato.Consegna puntuale, come al solito direi."
2852,"Ottimo prodotto, come solo l'originale sa essere"
2853,Arduino una garanzia. Ottimo prodotto. Consegna nei tempi previsti
2854,購入したものの使う予定でしたが使わなくなり結局動作確認だけした感じでしたが問題なく動きました見た目かっこよくておおとなりました笑
2855,Very good. Buy 1000s of these
2856,Good original product
2857,Power cable and connecting cables did not find in the box.
2858,Excelente para un estudiante de ingeniería
2859,"Excelente, simplifica el trabajo y a un precio asequible."
2860,Super für mein Testlabor mit Kunststoffhalterung für das Board und ein paar hübschen Aufklebern.Deutlich bessere Verarbeitung als bei den China Klonen und Support für das Projekt ;)
2861,"For forty quid, it's a stretch too far scrimping on a humble ESD bag to adequately protect the board from ESD.ESD stress is generally characterised by failure more likely after an indeterminate period of operation. Perhaps of limited concern if just a failed home project, but not so good when integrated to a serious system-level project as in my case.I really thought going 'genuine' would mean an improved quality focus - and all to save on a humble ESD bag.I think I'll stick with my present clone, 1/3rd the cost and adequately protected."

2873,Easy to set and with Arduino sketch.  But you have to look for proper plastic case for it
2874,Using this device as a logic probe on a breadboard project - the multitude of digital signals this can read makes it a core component for troubleshooting 6502 CPU activity
2875,"I ordered the first one.. worked for a less than week and the com port stop. RX and TX lights solid on with no connection.I returned that one and got a replacement MEGA. I was uploading sketch code yesterday and it too stopped only this time.. no RX or TX lights with or without a cable connected to the port. I was extremely careful with the 2nd one and it still lost its port. I was powering it with 12v dc which is regulated down to on the board.Its not the laptop.. It's been working with UNOs fine.Still giving 4 stars.. These are great boards.. With the bad luck this project has had, I'll just add that the failed ports to the every growing list of headaches."
2876,"It's exactly what I expected, and it has provided a nice first foray into microcontrollers for this old hand at programming and electronics.  It took only minutes to install the free IDE (integrated development environment -- the ""programming"" tool) and to run a test program on the board.  So far I've used it to drive strips of several hundred WS2812b individually addressable programmable LEDs for combination functional/aesthetic lighting installations, and it takes input from either pushbuttons or touch sensors (using I2C bus).  But essentially it was the quality I expected for the price I paid.That said...Having the included solid plastic base while prototyping and developing code is somehow a consistently underrated feature that this genuine Arduino Mega2560 board has.  I can't stress the benefits of avoiding: accidentally shorting, lowering resistance to ground of, or adding capacitance accidentally to a pin because the underside of the board is touched when moved, or dust containing some metallic particles you didn't notice is on your desk.  Point is, for all the functionality of this board, perhaps most impressive thing about the package was a single, undocumented, completely self-explanatory, highly useful simple accessory, simply because it isn't something most people have sitting around.  Seriously, how often does an included accessory require no installation, do it's job perfectly, not need replacing, be able to be removed if unwanted, requires no explanation, and avoids both potentially board-destroying situations AND potential programming nightmares where anomalous input could be intermittently created.  By including this feature, novice developers who are less likely to be actively aware of certain precautions are saved from a disturbingly short or horribly frustrating first experience working with microcontrollers.I also can't stress enough that if you use microcontrollers which make use of the Arduino IDE (which is MANY), it's a worth buying a slightly more expensive genuine Arduino product once and a while (if they fit your project) to support the company that provides the software and support for free to the world.  No, I'm not affiliated in any way, just a fan of their business model."
2877,A well-made unit that works out of the box. Expensive - but...
2878,Neither. It comes attached to a clear plastic plate.  You do get a few small stickers though
2879,"Arduino oficial,  poco que decir , calidad y rendimiento esperado por su precio , muy buen articulo."
2880,"La Scheda è adatta sia a Progetti didattici, che ad applicazioni abbastanza Professionali."
2881,I just love the Arduino. So many creativity and possibilities.
2882,The circuit board holder/base was cracked but the box it came in was fine (not crushed). I haven’t tried it yet but am pretty disappointed***updated***Customer service responded to this review and I have a new one coming tomorrow no charge.  I will update again when it arrives.  So far great customer service!*** got the new board in a day and works great!!  Great costumer service!!  Thanks!
2883,These boards work great and are compatible with the vast number of Arduino libraries available. Plenty of I/O  pins for interfacing. Can run off of USB connection or can be powered from and external (8-13V) supply for stand alone operation. The on board circuitry will automatically switch between USB power and external power when external power is applied.
2884,Meg is a cute new girlfriend for me. I hope I don't kill her like I killed uno :(
2885,"Box looked opened at one end but everything was inside and so far the board is working fine.  Fingers crossed.  Nice board, made in Italy."
2886,Not a clue what it does but followed the instructions for installation and download of firmware and it works brilliantly. Def recommended
2887,Cadeau
2888,Man sollte wissen worauf man sich einlässt.Man muss den Arduino programmieren kein Klik klik und fertig.Eine gute Ergänzung ist das Programm Visuino!
2889,great
2890,The product appears to be very well built. Fired up with no issues.
2891,"Have used this for years to control my outdoor Christmas displays.  Learning how to use it updated my 1980s tech skills into the 21st century -- for that, I am also grateful!"
2892,"El articulo llego antes de lo esperado.Se encontraba en perfectas condiciones, y era lo esperado."
2893,todo ok
2894,Arduino boards have a reputation to be made from top quality components and bullet proof and that is why I choose them. My last one had some issues communicating with my PC and I had to return and ask full refund. Bad luck?? I don't know. I'll continue using these products.
2895,This is my forth Arduino MEGA purchased within last two years. It works very well with all shields and breakout boards designed for it.For some application RAM size is an issue but still I give it 5 stars.
2896,"how disappointing!!! first, the board came with the case lid peeled out with scotch tape hanging loosely barely keeping product from coming out. then, a closer look reveals scratches and little ding here and there typically seen after a week of daily use, especially the lower plastic housing — just like my old uno board after a couple days on rough workbench top. haven’t had a chance to do a full check on functionality. ironically, I bought both this supposedly superior board together with the knock off brand. the plan was to use the cheap stuff to deal with tear and wear from early trial error prototype works, then use the real deal mega for fine tuning and for more robust performance closer to final design. now contemplating if it would turn out the other way around. The knock off board surprisingly came in with impressive craftsmanship, well sealed, packaged, and functioning with no issue so far. Very disappointed!!!! I didn’t pay for used, returned, or refurbished product!!!"
2897,Tolle Produkte sehr einsteiger freundlich.Verzeihen auch mal eine Falsche verkabelung.
2898,It works!  Up and programming it the on the day it was received!
2899,"I would suggest to anyone to buy the MEGA 2560 version of ARDUINO when learning to use/code Arduino projects ... any prototyping test items that you can do on an UNO you can do on a MEGA; however, with a Arduino MEGA 2560 you can do so much more with the extras it provides.  VERY happy with my purchase!  Really like being able to see the pin numbers/letters on the side as well as on the top."
2900,I used the Arduino and Motor Shield to build a DCC++ base station for my model railroad. It made a very economical choice to add digital control to my model railroad.
2901,"Great if you’re new to MCUs, but still quick and easy for prototyping later on."
2902,I always buy the original and never had issues with them (unlike some friends and their horror stories trying to save a few bucks)
2903,"Having had great success with Arduino Uno's and their clones, I purchased this Arduino Mega.  Unfortunately it does not load even the simplest sketches such as blink. According to the forums, there are many complaints about the Arduino Mega not loading sketches - gives a timeout error. This unit is supposedly not a Chinese copy. After days of trying, I was not able to find a solution which worked for my board. For the time being, I will need to stick with the uno."
2904,"Just excelente, fast shipping. I got what I expected. It even came with some nice stickers of arduino. Perfect"
2905,"When developing, it is comforting to be able to rely on the consistent quality of a Genuine Arduino controller."
2906,"Work without problem, board coming without the USB cable. Overall value is good, five start to Arduino yesm"
2907,Ordered this for a replacement on folgertech i3 prusa printer. I had messed up the USB connection on the board and bought this one to replace it.
2908,item worked A1 for a good price
2909,"It's not a clone, it's a ""real"" Arduino Mega 2560.  It seems to work perfectly ok.  I can program it using the Arduino IDE, run some sketches and it works."
2910,"UNO memory is very limited, using MEGA allows much more capable programs (application: 12x1-wire temp monitor, display, recording with ethernet shield)"
2911,"He usado ya varias decenas de arduinos mega, imitaciones y originales, y puedo afirmar que las imitaciones no son iguales que el original.  La calidad del regulador, soldaduras, etc del original nunca me han causado ningún problema, las imitaciones varias veces. La pega es que el original es caro, pero prefiero pagarlo."
2912,Buy a real Arduino you won’t regret it.  The knockoffs often substitute a cheap chip to drive the USB port and that causes compatibility problems with some example code.
2913,Good produkt
2914,"An Arduino that I use for railway modelling purposes. For these  the Mega is great because of the larger number of I/O pins and also timers, than the Uno. It is a little expensive though."
2915,Very good product
2916,"It seems an original Arduino MEGA board. But it came with damaged plastic detail, because it was sent in soft Amazon package. I really don't understand how Amazon sends electronics parts in such unsafe package.The board itself works good for the first check."
2917,Looks good. I like the labelled headers. Got here quick.
2918,Has many ports needed for my project
2919,Works great. I love it.Totally worth the money. I recommend everyone who likes arduino to get this board.
2920,Ottimo prodotto
2921,"Looks original, works well so far. I give it a 3 stars because I got an open box seal was open."
2922,"Easy to use great for beginners, like me."
2923,I love it!!!
2924,J'avais déjà le UNO R3. Pour étendre mes expériences j'avais besoin de plus de broches et de mémoires.Toujours une qualité et un usage irréprochable.
2925,Semplice e flessibile.
2926,"Dieser Mikrocontroller ist mega, ich kann ihn jedem weiterempfehlen."
2927,"Der Mega 2560 wurde in einer flachen Versandtasche ohne Polster im Format A4 für Zeitschriften versendet, so dass die Verpackung des Bausteins entsprechend zerdrückt war. Ein Wunder, dass dies der Mega selbst heil überstanden hat. Für den nicht gerade günstigen Kaufpreis eine echt schwache Leistung!"
2928,Box came a little splashed but everything else is fine.
2929,Super
2930,Servizio di consegna tramite locker molto valido. Il prodotto è stato conforme alle aspettative.
2931,"Prodotto noto che uso da tempo. Quello che avevo è stato danneggiato da un temporale. Ordinato al mattino, arrivato il giorno dopo. Eccezionale"
2932,"Prodotto originale, non ha bisogno di presentazioni. Consiglio di acquistare anche una custodia di protezione trasparente (forata) in modo da proteggerlo da eventuali depositi di polvere"
2933,Spitzen Gerät für Technikbegeisterte und solche die es noch werden wollen! Mit diesem Gerät hat man alle Möglichkeiten!
2934,Good
2935,"At some point while trying to flash a program while I was working with LoRa modules, this thing bricked itself. Apparently Ardus are known pretty well in the embedded community for this happening, so I bought an ISP/JTAG programmer and tried fixing it but it was royally screwed. Sent it back."
2936,Super carte de par ses possibilités de connexions.
2937,"Fantastic product from Arduino. Easy to use, learn and high quality."

2945,Item works as it should no issue's
2946,Ottimo prodotto. Consiglio a chi vuole qualcosa di più rispetto ad Arduino UNO.
2947,"This specific arduino board has a tendency to quit interacting with your pc after a few uploads. Do not waste your time, just buy an “Uno” model which is much more reliable. The overall build quality is good, but that doesn’t matter after the product stops functioning with normal use."
2948,"Analog pin ranges are not 0 - 5volts for 0 - 1023. More like 0.2 - 4.2 volts for 0 - 1023.Tested another mega 2560, one purchased from Sparkfun, read 0-5volts. I purchased 2,These are faulty or bad clones.0/10"
2949,"Un nome ed una garanzia, Arduino."

2975,"Easy to use.If you are having trouble, for example the device is not being recognized by windows.. Make sure you've got a USD cable that does DATA. Only 1 of 4 USB cables I tried has data support."
2976,"I gave this arduino three (3) stars because I also bought some that were non-brand that worked just as well (if not better) and didn't have such a high price tag. These seemed to have a problem with some of the PCs I was working with. It's good thing I had Windows 10 and not just Ubuntu for programming, otherwise I would have been out of luck for it to work."
2977,"This is an excellent Arduino Leonardo with Headers. I bought two of them for my robot projects. I'm glad I found them because they are hard to get. I had some old robot projects that required the Leonardo. So, I'm very happy to get them at this low price. I inspected both of them very carefully. They were in perfect condition."
2978,"I built an MDF DDR board with this as the brain. It was a super fun project and the fact someone already had coding built for the button mapping made things that much easier!I will be excited to make more projects and potentially swap, or maybe just buy more of these. The program flashing is very easy and quick."
2979,"I built a little throttle body for my flight simming use.You'll need to be willing to learn some coding, but the whole ecosystem of this product is amazing.

2980,"Arrivato nei tempi previsti, dotato di imballo e supporto in plastica. Tutto funzionante. Nessuna istruzione ma tutto rinvenibile sul sito ufficiale o attraverso il qr code nel foglio in dotazione."
2981,Prodotto che fa quello per cui è stato creato consigliato
2982,easy to program and deploy! Excellent value for the money.I was looking for the right chipset for HID device building and I've found my new platform.now my only problem is so many projects so little time!
2983,"Made an automated turret for my capstone, used this arduino with 2x servos, a stepper motor, and 5x range finding arrays, to build an automated turret.Love arduino, I still use the thing today!! Thank amazon for reminding me to do this review!!"
2984,"This is the first authentic Arduino I've bought and I'm glad I did. Copies are adequate but pin labels, silk screen, etc. are much nicer on the Italian board. I especially like the plastic half shell. Very small difference in price. Amazon orders direct from Arduino."
2985,From the best I can tell this is a genuine Arduino. Works fine and does what they say it can do. The nice thing about the Leonardo is that you can set up the USB interface to look like a HID (keyboard or mouse etc.)
2986,トップレビューを参考に真贋を見てみようと思ったら箱から全然違う!販売者もAmazonさんのものを買ったんですが、中身も写真と微妙に違うように見えるし(左下の辺り)よく分かりません。特に気になるのがPWMピンの数が商品説明には7と書いてあるのに、届いたものでは6になっていることです(背面画像参照)。リニューアルしたのでしょうか。どなたか教えてください〜。
2987,"What can I say?  This is the real deal, and not one of the cheaper knock offs.  If you need an genuine Arduino Leonardo (with headers), this is what you are looking for."
2988,"Hadn't ever used an Arduino before...fun project, works fine."
2989,"Thought it would go more easy. Spent a whole day but can't write a blink code yet. It would needs more time and research to use.Update:After replacing the usb cable to other one, it worked fine. The first one was ""power supply only"", not data transfer. That's the reason pc didn't recognize arduinos. As I don't like soldering, complex wiring works, it's a good thing to me."
2990,Lo he adquirido con la finalidad de empezar con el mundo de la electrónica y la programación y la verdad que estoy encantado.
2991,偽物があるらしいので、少し高いけれど、敢えて販売者がAmazonのものを選択して購入しました届いたものは商品ページの箱とは違っていました箱の封印シールは剥がした形跡ありますまた、バーコードの部分を隠すように白いシールが２箇所貼られていました箱の側面にはホログラムシールが貼られていたので箱は本物かも知れません基板をざっとみると商品ページの写真とは異なるパーツが実装されていましたまた、基板の裏面は、商品ページにあるような半分白ではなく、普通の基板でした箱を開けて中身だけ入れ替えた？のかどうかは、判りませんこういう商品は随時仕様変更されるので本物かどうかは販売元に聞くしかありませんが、Amazonが正直に答えてくれるかどうか判りません半分白というデザインは、奇抜なので本家が普通のデザインに戻すかなぁ？ちゃんと動けば構いませんが、偽物業者を肥えさせたのなら不快ですAmazonは出荷する商品の検品を十分にするべきです少なくとも封印シールは剥がした跡がある商品は出荷すべきではありません
2992,El leonardo como el micro permiten entre otras cosas hacer un emulador de teclado/ratón. Lo he utilizado para eso y ha funcionado como era de esperar: perfecto.
2993,"Bonjour,C'est mon 1er Arduino! Je n'ai donc pas de point de comparaison être celui la et un autre. Le seul truc que je peux dire c'est qu'il marche nickel et jamais eu de problème avec.Très bonne expérience, je le commande pour celui qui veux commander a coder un peut."
2994,Exactly as advertised. Good boards.
2995,"il prodotto non ha bisogno di presentazione, servizio eccellente"
2996,"Arduino è un prodotto di origine italiana di grande successo. Un successo da renderlo meritevole del nome Leonardo, un nome, che senza pensare alla ricorrenza dei 500 anni, dalle mie parti rimanda subito, come di riflesso, al nome Leonardo Da Vinci. E qui è difficile dire di più, trovare aggettivi adeguati non è facile ...Recapitato puntualmente ed in condizioni pefette. Funziona benissimo."
2997,Used as part of a 3D build to make an autopilot module for flight sim 2020
2998,"Llego a tiempo y es la placa original arduino, funcio o con solo enchufarla (bien sin el cable de datos). Todo tal cual lo esperado"
2999,I'm using it to run a simple RFID card reader.

3002,"Man kann viel mit dem Produkt machen, vorallem wann man über 10 Jahre programmiererfahrung hat. Viel Code ""eingepackt"", für ein MIDI-Synthesizer mit MIDI-TRU Funktion, über USB und MIDI Stecker."
3003,らくだマート様から購入させて頂きましたレビューにもあった、強力な粘着テープ、ホログラムを見る限り正規品で間違いないようです。しかし外箱の状態が悪く、セロハンテープで上から補強しているような状態でした。中の状態はまだ確認していないので後程レビューしたいと思います
3004,"Ich habe mir zum experimentieren das Arduino Leonardo Board bestellt.Trotz des hohen Preises von 20€ habe ich mich für dieses Angebot entschieden, weil ich gerade beim Umgang mit vielen elektronischen Teilen auf dem Tisch ich die Kunststoffplatte unter dem Baord als sehr positiv empfunden habe. Dies ist in meinen Augen ein PLUS-Stern.Die Lieferung erfolgte in der Zeit. Weiterer PLUS-Stern.Die Lieferung war ordentlich und antistatisch verpackt auch ein PLUS-Stern.Leider fehlt bei der Lieferung ein passendes MIKRO-USB Kabel, was ich also erst in meinem FUNDUS heraussuchen musste. NUN GUT vielleicht habe ich bei der Bestellung nicht genügend gelesen und es war eben nicht aufgelistet. Somit NEUTRAL-Stern.Die Inbetriebnahme war dann jedoch schon eine Herausforderung, ob es an meinem Kabel gelegen hat oder nicht leider funktionierte der LEONARDO nur mit einem von 4 Kabeln... andere gleichwertige Geräte fünktionieren mit allen Kabeln also ich werte das als NEGATIV-Stern für diesen Leonardo. Aber sowohl an einem MAC, als auch an einem WIN-Rechner habe ich es letztlich angesprochen bekommen.Ziel meiner Experimente ist es eine neue Unterrichtsreihe für meine Schülerinnen und Schüler im Informatikunterricht zu gestalten. Dabei soll eine Spiel unter Windows programmiert werden und mit Hilfe des Arduino als Steuerkonsole gesteuert werden. Deshalb habe ich begonnen die Kommunikation zwischen Leonardo und Windows-Rechner über die USB-Schnittstelle herzustellen. Das ist bei Leonardo ja recht einfach. Bereits nach dem 7. UPLOAD war leider der Leonardo nicht mer erreichbar und ein weiterer UPLOAD war nicht mehr möglich. Es scheint so, dass die FIRMWARE und / oder der UPLOADER auf dem BOARD zerschossen ist. Da ich mich stets mit der offiziellen ARDUINO-Software daran gesetzt habe und ein anderes BOARD weiterhin funktioniert, habe ich also nach 7 Uploadversuchen nun einen Arduino Leonardo hier liegen, der nicht mehr erreichbar ist. Das System ist also nicht mehr funktional. Das führt zu einem 4fachen NEGATIV-Stern.Vielleicht kann in der kommenden Woche ein neues Aufspielen von FIRMWARE und UPLOADER das teure SPIELZEUG wieder zum Leben erwecken. So ist es gerade vollkommen Schrott und verdient an sich gar keinen STERN.ziemlich enttäuschend, dieses BOARD würde ich meinen Schülerinnen und Schülern nicht zum KAUF empfehlen.Man braucht definitiv eine Möglichkeit den bootloader neu zu brennen. Scheinbar wird dieser bei häufigem reset und Wechsel des usb - Anschlusses beschädigt. Ganz erklären kann ich mir dies ich nicht. Da das Ding ja nun nach bootloader neu brennen wieder geht setze ich die Sternzahl auf 2,5."
3005,Used this for the simFX project to control 4 servo's ...works great
3006,Confezione aperta ma l'oggetto senza evidenti difetti o rottura
3007,Muy útil y versátil
3008,Leonardo　開発ボードシリーズじゃないとコピペでできないのでこれを使いました。他の使い方がありますが　自分の場合VRCPROを動かすためにこれを買いました。受信機とプロポの性能が反応スピードを左右しますが、遅延がだいぶなくなり快適です。プロポ　４PLS　受信機R334SBS　ハイレスモードで駆動してます。　このデバイスを使用したことで受信機の性能差を知ることができてよかったです。今までプロポ側依存で反応スピードを占めていると思っていましたが、　受信機のスペックもあるようです。(フレームレートが変わります。）
3009,Leonardoは、HIDとして認識してくれると聞き、購入してみました。USB Host Shieldと一緒に購入して、キーボードのリマップに使用しています。

3014,arrivato funzionante
3015,Many sensors on the board were dysfunctional
3016,could have done with the headers in the packet rather than soldered on.  but I have been informed I could have bought without headers pre-soldered
3017,"This is my second Nano 33 BLE. The first was without headers (they were supplied but not soldered on). The problem with this 'with headers' board is that arguably they're on the wrong side. If you want to mount the board conveniently so you can get at the USB socket and see the LED, you have to mount it pins down. I guess this OK if you're plugging the whole board into a female header, but otherwise it's almost impossible to mount because long M1 bolts are hard to come by.The other problem is that the Arduino BLE library is poorly documented and quite buggy, and depending on what you want to do you may hit obscure problems - I spent many hours tracking down a flaw in the library which stopped my application working after a random period.However, at such an incredibly low price for such powerful hardware it's perhaps churlish to complain!"
3018,Bien
3019,Nice product. This arduino does not have as mich exemples and librairies to access all it function. So it is harder to use. But when you figure it out its fun.
3020,I am very satisfied with the product. I would recommend.
3021,"I uploaded a sketch for the onboard acceleration sensor, and the board stopped responding, didn't appear in the dev environment or in the Windows device manager.I turns out that some sketches interfere with the onboard serial, and you have to double press the reset switch on the board to manually set it to programming mode."
3022,These devices are so user friendly and easy to use and program. Love what they do for my projects.
3023,"I thought I would try this out since it seemed handy to have the ble built in the microcontroller.But for me the deal breaker was the painfully slow compiling.You would be much better off getting an external ble module and wiring that up to a different  microcontroller (which is what I ended up doing).If your requirements are to simply have a micro-controller (and a not very flexible one at that) that acts as a simple ble peripheral then it does what it claims to do, just be forewarned that compiling is really slow.cheers"

3070,Arduino Due è un concentrato di potenza di calcolo ma soprattutto è bello perché ci puoi davvero collegare di tutto. Sarebbe certamente la mia board di elezione se solo avesse un modulo WiFiNina integrato e un sistema di ricarica/backup lipo simile a quello dell'MKR WiFi 1010. Un po' più di attenzione riguardo la disponibilità di librerie non guasterebbe.
3071,It's the last Arduino board you'll ever need.
3072,"The Due from arduino.cc (the original Arduino group) has been discontinued, but Arduino.org (you can read up on the issues between the .cc and .org groups) made this Due board. That would be the only difference.The number of pins and amount of memory make this board especially useful. And as an added plus, it works with the Arduino Yun Shield (see the arduino.cc website)  which allows the Due to communicate via Bridge.h to the Yun (which runs Linux and includes wifi and ethernet connectivity).Just add this to your Due sketch:  #include <BridgeClient.h>  // Arduino Due to Yun Shield communication  BridgeClient client;You can also access Linux processes by including:  #include <Process.h>which, for example, will allow the Due to get the current system date and time from the Yun.Over-the-air programming is the nicest feature of the Due-Yun combination which allows programs to be upload to the Due when it is connected to wifi. To enable this functionality, you first upload a sketch to the Due via USB with the setup() containing the line 'checkForRemoteSketchUpdate()' as shown below:void setup() {  checkForRemoteSketchUpdate();  // use for Due when programming over Yun Shield}void loop() {  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:}After that, sketches can be uploaded by just including 'checkForRemoteSketchUpdate();' as the first line in the setup.From [...]DUE boards special noteThis board can be programmed remotely, but the way it interacts with the Yún shield requires a specific procedure that it is initialized by the checkForRemoteSketchUpdate() function. As suggested by the name this instruction is responsible to check if there is a new sketch to upload on the board. This is required only on the Due because you need to erase the flash before uploading a new sketch. The same action is performed automatically when you upload a sketch using any of the USB ports. Check the example called RemoteDueBlink includedin the Bridge library (Example -> Bridge -> RemoteDueBlink), which introduces you on how to use the checkForRemoteSketchUpdate() function. You must first load such a sketch via USB and also remember that any remotely loaded sketch must have that instruction to maintain the remote upload functionality.In order to enable the remote upload feature you need to install the SAM core version 1.6.8 or greater.To ensure that remote upload works you need to power the DUE from the barrel jack or using the Native USB port."
3073,"DUE is super efficient compared to what I was using, nano. It comes with a plastic base and has a neat finishing. I had to buy a micro usb cable separately and that's the only thing I wish they highlighted in the product details."
3074,"Had a project that needed more I/O than the standard fare Arduino, but also needed native USB support. This did the trick."
3075,"I have used it for about 1 week.  Have programmed to use Bluetooth, serial ports, LED's, Analog inputs, i2c, and PWM.All seems to work just fine.  However, there is on big caveat of this new Due board.First the good, it is fast compared to UNO, even Mega 2560.  The programming of this ARM based board is almost identicalto the Mega 2560.  You do have to use the 1.5 ARDUINO IDE which is still in beta as of now.  So, if you are comfortablewith the previous offerings of the Arduino, you will be able to program this realtively easy.Now, the caveat.  The board is 3.3 volt, and can easily be damaged by applying higher voltage to the inputs.Another critical aspect of this new fast board is teh compatibility issues with the existing shields.  Most of the boardsthat I have from 2560 are probably not safe to use with this board.  I have not tried some of the shields due tothe possibility of ending up with scrap Due.For most development, I will stay with 2560.  And if I need more power, I will move up to BeagelBone Black or otherofferings that are now being introduced.  The shields that Ialready have by and large cannot be used with thisDue.  Maybe at later time, this board will be more widely used and more shields designed for it.  But, for nowit is not ready for the prime time."
3076,"This review is written in Feb, 2014.This is a great board with all the features I needed and wanted. Lots of IO and PWM, DAC, I2C and SPI, 87Mhz processing. The board itself is great!The problems come in the moment you start to add shields and libraries. Most libraries were written for the ATMega chip, and will not even compile on the Due without being rewritten. While the Due has an awesome micro-controller, a large number of 3rd party libraries will not work with it. A lot of programming got simplified with the Due, which lends to the problem of libraries not working. In some ways, it is very easy to program by comparison.The SPI has moved off of the standard pins and is now ONLY accessible through the SPI pens. This means that any shield using the previous SPI standard pins (10, 11, 12, 13) will not work. Even worse, they also moved SPI off of the standard ICSP header, causing much confusion. I have yet to get anything(!) that uses SPI to work with this board; which is a huge disappointment for me.In short, I hope that the Due is the new standard for Arduino. It's a great board that is woefully unsupported. If they stick to this being the new standard, more libraries will be converted, and shields will be redesigned. If you ask my opinion, I'd wait longer before buying this."
3077,"If you are buying this, odds are you are a tinkerer who wants something a bit more powerful than an Arduino Uno. It has an exhaustive list of useful features such as 4 UARTs, 512K flash, etc. One feature that caught my eye were the 2 digital to analog converter (DAC) pins. To test them, I used them to dim an led which is nice, but pwm can do that too. My main interest was in sound synthesis so I hooked up an 8 Ohm speaker between DAC0 and ground and wrote a sketch to generate a saw wave. It worked for about 5 seconds and then stopped forever.I then did research after the fact and found that the DAC pins can only source 3mA. After doing some Ohm's Law, (V=I*R)=(R=V/I)=(R=3.3/0.003), in order to safely hook stuff up to the DAC/any low current pin, you need at least 1100 Ohms of resistance between the pin and ground. I was conscious of the fact that it uses 3.3V logic, but forgot to consider current draw. The Arduino Uno seems a bit more ""rugged"". I have hooked up the 8Ohm speaker directly to it without any troubles which is why I thought I could do the same here. Luckily, the seller has been very kind and understanding and is replacing it for me despite my oversight.Overall, it is a great product, it just requires a bit more caution to use over previous arduinos."
3078,"I wanted a battery powered board to log high frequency (500Hz) analog data.The good: the Due is fast, has 12-bit analog to digital converters.  The additional RAM and flash are great, and for the money you get a very powerful little board.The bad: it was difficult to lower the power consumption, and even with the chip in deep sleep, there is still about 13mA draw just from the board.  The hardware SPI pins are only on the ICSP-like header in the middle.  Software SPI works fine, but many libraries assume that if it's a Due, you're using hardware SPI.Also, the naming is a bit annoying.  For one, Due sounds like it might be a nickname for a Duemilanove, but these are entirely different boards.  And searching for Due is tricky since it appears much more often as regular English word.I'd suggest also looking at the Teensy 3.1 - similar chip but smaller, cheaper and much lower power."
3079,"This is the genuine Arduino Due made in Italy. It is a much more powerful microcontroller than the Mega (check the specs... it has 2 real D/A pins, lots of memory, and a Cortex CPU that is even capable of real-time FFT).On the other side it's also more delicate than the Mega. It's a 3.3V board and there is no overvoltage protection so if you connect 5V to any data pins then it'll likely brick the controller. The pins can only source 10-15mA current (check the pinout diagram, it differs pin by pin), so the usual trick of creating extra Vcc pins by pulling a data pin high is not going to work.You need to check your shields carefully before you connect. Almost all Adafruit shields (and faithful replicas) are Due compatible, but cheapo LCD shields that have buttons are feeding 5V back to the analog pins - don't use these.I'm using this to drive a sound-reactive NeoPixel plasma display and it's very fast and easy to program with Arduino IDE."
3080,"I wasn't quite sure how sheerness was being used in the ratings so I gave it five stars. The board is a genuine ""Genuino"" Arduino, so in that way it is sheer Arduino. The Due itself is not sheer as being transparent but the mounting plate that is included is quite sheer.The packaging was fine and the delivery was prompt."
3081,"I wanted to create my own switch panel for DCS World Steam game. I saw so many Youtube videos of people who did it but no one had a good video on what they used and how it was done. I thought it did not matter which card you would get, let me tell you it does, You might be able to use the Due but the Leonardo might be better for the task. I will continue to try my project and see if I can accomplish it. I do recommend the card just remember it is a micro board so it is very small don't let the images full you."
3082,"I did not open this until after return was no longer available. Upon first use, it failed to turn on."
3083,"I have used these a lot at my past few jobs when we need a simple thing automated. I've used it to drive a custom high-speed DAC, to mimic thermocouple signals, drive 300 W heaters, run through SPI memory, perform fake quadrature readings, etc. These are pricier than a more traditional Arduino but they are absolutely worth it from my perspective due to the native built-in DACs (with a little odd voltage range but I can manage with that) and 12-bit analog inputs. I like them so much I have one in my backpack at all times. This doesn't hand with a dedicated microcontroller but my line of work is to make rapid prototypes and these do the trick every time."
3084,"At $17 - $22, the Arduino Due is an amazing 32 bit value. I buy them any time I see a good price, and use them in over 60% of my project prototypes. [for a lot of projects, 32 bit microcomputer is just plain over-kill].Especially if you write interrupt - driven code, with any/all pins configurable as an interrupt input removes most barriers. I am using a Datalogger from AdaFruit to trigger an interrupt every 15 minutes to log Chlorine & Turbidity measurements for State drinking Water reports. The trick is that I use 555 timers to expand a pulse [configured right out of the Radio shack book] to accept a trigger  from one pin to cause an interrupt on another.Thus, the Arduino Due can self-trigger [soft] interrupts - very powerful for 20 bucks."
3085,"This is a great microcontroller. I have an Arduino Uno for components which use 5 volts and I can use this one for 3.3 volt devices (although you can use a logic level shifter). One unexpected feature is that it can produce true random numbers from within the processor (you can use a library to access this feature) which gives 32 random bits every 84 clock cycles.It has a 32 bit architecture and lots of input/output ports. I am very pleased with it but I think having a small amount of RAM holds it back a little considering that it is a 32 bit processor.There are numerous other features like a real time clock, temperature sensor etc which are detailed on the Arduino website.Overall, a marvellous product."
3086,Easy to use.  Compiled/uploaded sketch and computer recognized it as a MIDI device w/o all the fuss of using a MEGA or other non-compliant board.
3087,"Love the Arduino.  I decided to try the Due because it had more memory and I was maxing out my Unos.  It is not a trivial conversion but I think it will be worth it.  Some of the libraries need to be upgraded (or are in the process of being upgraded).  I needed to rewrite my SW serial to work with the new HW ports.  I have not totally figured out which of my shields can run at 3.3v on the Due whereas everything was 5v with the Uno.  My RTC is definitely not compatible at 5v only.  The SD slot on my Ethernet shield works, though I have not yet tried the Ethernet itself...  All in all no major surprises."
3088,Excelente para el proyecto de cálculo que deseo realizar. Excelente calidad de producto.
3089,"Great board if you do not need to use I2C. Currently, I2C (and possibly another protocol) do not work properly. I would give it 5 stars, but I bought it to use with an LCD display... so it's a no go for my current project. While it is still fine for other projects, I marked it down due to the fact I am on hold until another board (Nano Every) arrives."
3090,"I bought these Arduino Dues vrom Mp3Car via Amazon for $40.22 each.  They appear to be genuine, not counterfeit.  Be careful with the power; apply power to the Due before applying voltages to its inputs.  Otherwise, voltage at inputs goes through the protection diodes and the Due might start running its ""sketch"".  Too much power through a protection diode will burn out the diode and destroy the input or the whole chip."
3091,"Description is 100% accurate, this is an Arduino-branded Due board, not a copycat from another manufacturer.If you're pretty advanced with Arduino, and find that you've pushed to the absolute limits of the 16MHz instruction cycle of other boards, but you don't have the time/don't want to put in the effort of learning how to program a microcontroller without the helping hand of the Arduino libraries, this is absolutely worth the money."
3092,"The specification states: ""a power jack, an ICSP header, a JTAG header, and a reset button"" however no power jack or headers were soldered to the board.  The pictures quite clearly show these items fitted."
3093,"Best Arduino for robotics , has decent support and a faster microcontroller."
3094,I got this for a DIY Camera project and this is to be the controller board--overall it works great for that project--recently when I pugged in my project it doesn't power up--but I'm sure it's probably the shield that I had fried--as this is a genuine Arduino board that part usually doesn't fry out.
3095,"Questa verisone di Arduino ha enormi potenzialità in confronto a UNO e anche rispetto a MEGA, di cui rispetta la piedinatura. Differenza fondamentale 32bit, clock e memoria ma soprattutto il fatto che tutto il sistema funziona a 3.3 V e quindi non necessita di level converter se interfacciato con molti dei sensori/lettori che si trovano in commercio. Unica pecca il fatto che alcune librerie che vanno bene per Arduino (5V nelle varie versioni) non sono compatibili con il DUE."
3096,
3097,"This is a genuine Arduino. This board doesn't need explanation anymore. It is a pretty powerful device; coupled with the friendly Arduino IDE, you can make a lot with this board without much E.E. knowledge."
3098,There's not much say. Great quality! And it doesn't come with the reset problem (not resetting after power-up) like others.
3099,The ability to attach interrupts to any of the pins is amazing. The Cortex M3 just has so much more processing power than the ATMega in the UNO. Only thing I would wish is for the board to expose all the 100+ pins available on the M3.
3100,"Arrived fast, and is a great product. I already had the Arduino Decima, and this works in the same way."
3101,Great board. Can tell the difference in the quality of the pcb compared to non-original models.The due board is overall a very powerful board and is exactly what you need if you want to do multitasking with arduino.
3102,its original and works better than Chinese copies
3103,Genuine Ardunio  from Italy.  Many programs do not run on this unit which were create for the Uno but that is up to the hacker to figure out.  Board is solid and has better quality components vs generic 'Ardunios'.
3104,meets my expectations
3105,A little bit different getting used to working below 3.3V but that is where things are going and have to go with CPU's nowadays.  Sill haven't begun to see the potential that this thing has.  Definitely recommend it though.
3106,"No es la placa original y el acabado de las soldaduras no es del todo correcto.Arduino permite por su licencia que se realicen copias del hardware. La placa en las primeras pruebas parece que funciona correctamente.El producto llego dos días después, no tengo claro que sea culpa del vendedor porque al enviarlo por Correos es díficil de verificar, entiendo que puede ser un simple error en Correos más que del vendedor que indico que la había enviado a las pocas horas de comprarlo.Por el resto bien."
3107,現物確認したところ写真で示したように純正品です。これまでに２～３０枚ほど使いました。I2CもSPIもちゃんと使えています。ストロベリーリナックスのSPI対応ステッピングモータドライバやAmazonでも売られているMPU6050（I2C）も動作実績があります。Uartも4chあるのでXbeeやら周辺機器との接続も十分可能でした。ただ、Uartは複数チャンネル使う場合、ある程度ボーレートを落とさないと文字化けすることがありましたので注意です。電源電圧が3.3VなためArduino Uno用のシールドがそのまま使えないことも多く、たいがい自分でシールド製作をすることになります。といいながら、CPUパワーは相当ありますのでイロイロやらせるにはもってこいです。USB以外の外部電源を用いる際はあまり高い電圧を入れるとレギュレータから発熱しやすいので注意です。あまり知名度の無いボードですがUNOで満足できなくなった方にはお勧めの好いボードです。
3108,niice . like the way it came on a plastic base.
3109,３DプリンタでMarlin2.0.xを動作させるために購入しました。最初はDueの互換品を買ったのですが、頻繁にスケッチの書き込みエラーが発生するのと、リセットを書けてもスケッチが開始されずにGコードセンダーと接続が確立してようやく動き出すという具合に我慢できずに純正品を買いなおしました。現在は快適に動作しています。
3110,Great little board. Works good on the 6 axis camera mount I made.
3111,"This one has a lot of analog and pwm pins and really good for robotic!And has both 3.3v and 5v, I can use more module on this board."
3112,"This is a powerful, easy to use microcontroller board.  It is currently running a research project for my electrical engineering degree.  Good stuff."
3113,"The microcontroller arrived in excellent condition, works properly. I've already used for some applications with sensors and actuators, as well as DC motor control."

3289,excellent product. AC in is plug type and removable. stable isolated power output. solved the ground loop issue of my bluetooth receiver connected to the amp.
3290,Good
3291,Ok
3292,Delivered as in Picture
3293,The received product was not exactly as shown in the pictures. They are not pre-soldered. You need to get the PCB and the terminal blocks done.

3300,Ok
3301,Satisfied
3302,Working......  But one time as stop
3303,Not really the good product as shown in description
3304,"Good,but minimum speed bemuch lower"
3305,Product details not provided and amp and voltage ratings.
3306,"I am using this product for 1100w electric kettle as heat controller , while using slightly it's heat sink temperature increases , but satisfied 👍"
3307,Best to control high voltage for sensitive devices. Saves money for costly repairs
3308,"After second time use it's not work, very bad quality"
3309,It's awrve the purpose n good...have to manage a box to set this in...
3310,I used to control speed of mt angle grinder. It reduce the speed from 12000rpm to 6000 rpm. Not lesser than that.
3311,Like
3312,I am happy with the working of this device
3313,Genuine reviewIt’s just a fine product (not up to the mark)We have to do so any changes to fix it on the extension board.I didn’t get a better result from this. But it’s slowing down the speed of the motor ( not slowing very much )I used a piece of plastic as the board to fix it( you can use Old regulator switch of ceiling fan. *just remove the regulator part from the switch and use that switch to fix this regulator)

3324,500 watt hitting element का तापमान कन्ट्रोल करने के लिए इसका उपयोग करता हु
3325,Reduces spoed of my drill and angle grinder (11000rpm to 1000rpm)It's not 0 - 2000 watt regulator.Minimum voltage is 110 v
3326,I am an industrial electrician and I needed a good regulator for a 300 watt my high speed home made stand fan. And it is working fine now.  But you have to adjust the starting voltage with the VCC screw according to the requirement. This is given in this regulator and it is not giving me any problem right now.  You can regulate it within 2000 watts.
3327,"I was a bit sceptical to buy this.I needed this to control the speed of my angle grinder,earlier I had tried with a fan regulator but it didnt work.It absolutely serves the purpose and the speed is very much controlled to suit your work.Very very low speeds in grinder are not needed as in a drill machine."
3328,"Products working fine only  15 day's after that it's  not working maybe it's burn,  only 1500w load"
3329,So I used this to make a speed controller for my angle grinder. I can now use the grinder for buffing and polishing my vehicles just like they do in the buff shops.Good stuff and works really well. It regulates the voltage and thus the speed of the instrument is increased or reduced as required
3330,I connect this device in bench drilling machine. Motor has 250watt. 1400rmp. This circuit works well. While reducing speed from 1400rpm very slow response once it reached 1000rpm. Motor stall. Below 1000rpm motor doesn't work. I am using this dimmer to reducing 400rpm only. In my bench drilling machine. Below 1000rpm motor stall. This item is not suitable for bench dill.
3331,
3332,"The product is an above average one. When the seller can include a thank you card with details if their other collections, it would have been prudent had they included a pamphlet containing the wiring instructions or diagram for the benefit of the buyers."
3333,Very bad in quality wise.....it couldn't hold polishing machine work
3334,"I have received this 2""X2.5""X1"" module in a big 6""X4.5""X2.5"" cardboard box without any packing material. It does not even have any paper/document describing connection or rating.  The module does not even have any marking on the terminal describing what to connect where!!  THough I have not yet used the module, first impression is something not good"
3335,I am using this regulator for half HP booster motor with maximum 5-6 amp current and it is working fine since last 2 years.
3336,"Pocket friendly and can be used for short duration, about 10mins. I used it to control a single phase induction motor speed. The lower the speed you set, the hotter the product gets and starts loosing speed control. However, it did the job after I started running it intermittently for 10mins and switching off the system for 5mins to let this product cool down."
3337,Nice product but a instruction manual would have had been good. Current using with desert cooler.
3338,"Bought to reduce speed of DeWalt 810 angle grinder. It does reduce the speed to some extent ,but does not bring it down to real slow rotations. Maybe reduces from 13500 rpm to about 6000 not lesser than that."
3339,Tried with 150 watt blower motor load. Hum noticed at low speed. Little warm up observed.
3340,"Good, but only can reduce half of the existing speed of Grinder"
3341,Output Voltage variations on load
3342,"Made a speed controller for drilling machine attachment. Works great. My drill is of 2000rpm max. It lowers it to 1000,i think on lowest setting."
3343,"I have connected with an angle grinder, used for other purpose, and is working nice in regulating the rpm of the grinder !!!👍"
3344,"I have bought several of these speed regulators. Sometimes these work, sometimes they don't. This one worked until I enclosed it in a protective cover. After that it stopped working. The seller provided no help to fix or replace it .  Be very careful to enclose them properly so they don't over heat. They brake easily . Try it out immediately so you can send it back within the allotted time... 10 days"
3345,"Good light dimmer ( incandescent bulbs ) as well as fan regulator. Just remember not to set it too low , the fan would stall and not have enough starting current. Also can be used for controlling temperature of heating coils."
3346,"Nice This, adjust speed & RPM....Useful This One.."
3347,Good quality....
3348,its simple to connect and simple to use product.
3349,Very good
3350,Working smoothly. I have not tested the max ampacity and time'duration. Not suitable for layman as this is open type without terminal markings.This is my wifes login. Kishore Kumar
3351,This product working properly you can adjust 220v ac to 90v ac.
3352,"Used it for drill, the is speed change is very little."
3353,Good purchase but price is high considering components in the cct board.
3354,
3355,Super
3356,Very useful
3357,It should come with covered casing or fitted in plug top
3358,"I used it for 120 Watt polishing machine with universal motor, works excellent. Good quality and good pricing, we have purchased 4 nos more after successful trials"
3359,Good product but there must be circuit diagram of it.
3360,TV ko jyada power na mile is liye
3361,Working good with my 2000w room heater.
3362,Bought this for my symphony Air cooler as that was too noisy.This regulator lowers the input voltage to a lower level and hence lower noise.
3363,nice product. working is fine. user interface is somewhat not gud due  to size. and main drawback is it can not consists of any box for protection while at the time of using no protection is there for  220v input. so i am giving 3star for less protection
3364,It not control the speed..But it reduces speed 50%
3365,Work great......
3366,Good product nice work in 1000watt cooler fan
3367,"Working well, we fixed to a battery charging station. Initially a bit confused, later we fix it properly."
3368,Not working perfectly
3369,Good
3370,Very good product ..
3371,Good work
3372,I used only once and then it stopped working. Not sure what wrong with it.
3373,It is usefull to control predefined range of temperature to automate electrical heater and fan simultaneously.
3374,
3375,Works well. If the lower range can be increased it will be more better.
3376,
3377,
3378,Very useful in this for angle grinder speed controler
3379,Voltage range is not as described. It does not go below 170V. Doesn't work for my requirement.
3380,The decide does not he job but it's not that effective at regulating the speed. I don't think it's value for money. Built quality looks average
3381,Very useful
3382,Good product. Go for it.
3383,Works well
3384,"Checked, working perfectly.I like it."
3385,
3386,This product deserve a thumbsup. I will post detailed review after 2 months of use. In the meantime i will give it 4 star. I will add more after it passes its warranty period.
3387,
3388,Value for money
3389,Perfect circuit.Used it to reduce speed of my angle grinder.Working well
3390,"I am using it on my angle grinder, Almonard Tempest Pedastal fan, for temperature control on my 23litre OTG.Works just as expected. Have been using for past 2 weeks with good results."
3391,Small in size but does the job for slowing the speed of angle grinder
3392,Variable potmeter was defected .I change it from my own money.Now it works smoothly..
3393,"Nice, but not run sufficient speed motor"
3394,Good quality
3395,"the product came nicely packed, but it's useless.it has a voltage range of only 40 volts. from 190 to 230 volts.which hardly makes any difference for speed alteration of an ac motor.i had requested for return of this product but 3 times  after placing A RETURN REQUEST NO ONE CAME TO PICK UP"
3396,"Does its job, u may jave toake space in a box, good dimmer"
3397,Don’t use it angle grinder
3398,Value for money. I am using for speed control of my Angel grinder
3399,Good produch
3400,Super
3401,good one
3402,Good
3403,It is working well. To adjust- to  reduce or increase the speed we have to adjust the screw on variable pot as per our requirement. tested with my 300w drilling machine. working well.
3404,Works good enough with drill and grinders as speed control.
3405,Nice product👍
3406,I want replacement or repair Product. Please make Arranged scheduled.
